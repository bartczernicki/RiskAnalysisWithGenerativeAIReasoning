# Consolidated Important Risk Factor Changes from Microsoft's 2023 and 2024 10-K Filings

Below is a consolidated table highlighting the significant and impactful risk factor changes from Microsoft's 2023 and 2024 10-K reports. Each risk factor includes an assessment of the potential impact and key insights into why the change is important.

| **Risk Factor Title** | **Change** | **Potential Impact** | **Key Insights** |
|-----------------------|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Security of our information technology** | **Modified** | Acknowledging actual cybersecurity incidents, including a nation-state attack, raises concerns about increased vulnerability and ongoing threats. Potential impacts include reputational harm, loss of customer trust, legal liabilities, and higher security costs, which could adversely affect financial performance and operations. | Shifting from discussing potential cyber threats to admitting specific incidents indicates a heightened risk level. This transparency, while necessary, highlights the seriousness and immediacy of cybersecurity challenges facing Microsoft. It emphasizes the need for robust security measures and may affect stakeholder confidence. |
| **Security of our products, services, devices, and customers' data** | **Modified** | Admitting that attacks have directly affected customers increases exposure to customer dissatisfaction, potential legal actions, and reputational damage. This may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, loss of business, and the necessity for greater investment in security measures, affecting operational costs and financial performance. | Updating the risk to reflect actual impacts on customers underscores the severity of security threats. It signifies a shift from hypothetical risks to real-world consequences, highlighting the critical need to enhance security efforts to protect customer data and maintain trust. |
| **Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability** | **Modified** | The inclusion of current legal claims related to AI and new legislative developments, such as the EU's AI Act and the U.S.'s AI Executive Order, introduces legal and compliance risks. Potential impacts include increased legal expenses, restrictions on AI development, and negative effects on financial performance and strategic AI initiatives. | The addition of specific legal challenges and regulatory references reflects the growing scrutiny and regulation of AI technologies. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI heightens exposure to these risks. This change highlights the need for careful management of AI-related legal and ethical considerations to mitigate potential liabilities. |
| **Our products and services, how they are used by customers, and how third-party products and services interact with them, may present security, privacy, and execution risks** | **New** | Broadening the scope to include risks from customer use and third-party interactions increases the company's exposure to security and privacy vulnerabilities. This may lead to higher compliance and security costs and a more complex risk profile, potentially affecting operations and financial results. | Introducing this new, broader risk factor indicates Microsoft's recognition of the expanded landscape of potential risks. By encompassing issues beyond IoT, the company acknowledges the complexities of managing security and privacy in an interconnected ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of proactive risk management strategies. |
| **We may have additional tax liabilities** | **Modified** | The IRS seeking an additional $28.9 billion in taxes, plus penalties and interest, poses a significant financial risk. This could materially affect Microsoft's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow, with potential impacts on investor confidence and stock value. | The disclosure of a substantial potential tax liability highlights heightened financial and regulatory risks. This change stresses the importance of resolving tax disputes and could signal increased scrutiny from tax authorities, necessitating careful financial planning and potential reserve allocations. |
| **Subject to evolving sustainability regulatory requirements and expectations** | **New** | Emerging sustainability laws and regulations could impose additional compliance costs, operational changes, and increased capital expenditures. Failure to meet sustainability goals may result in legal actions, fines, reputational harm, and adverse effects on financial performance and market position. | Recognizing sustainability as a distinct risk factor reflects the growing regulatory and societal emphasis on environmental responsibility. This addition signals that Microsoft must prioritize sustainability initiatives to meet regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations, potentially influencing its strategic direction and investment priorities. |

## Summary of Key Changes and Implications

- **Elevated Cybersecurity Risks:** Microsoft's acknowledgement of actual cybersecurity incidents, including those affecting customers, marks a significant shift from potential to realized threats. This elevates the company's risk profile and indicates a need for intensified security measures.

- **AI-Related Legal and Ethical Challenges:** The expanded discussion on AI reflects heightened awareness of the legal, regulatory, and reputational risks associated with AI development and use. Microsoft's involvement with OpenAI and the mention of specific legislation underscore the importance of navigating AI's complex landscape responsibly.

- **Significant Tax Liabilities:** The substantial potential tax payment sought by the IRS introduces a major financial risk. This development could have material adverse effects on Microsoft's financial condition and necessitates careful attention to tax compliance and dispute resolution.

- **Broader Risk Recognition:** The introduction of new risk factors concerning product use, third-party interactions, and sustainability indicates Microsoft's expanding view of its operating environment. This broader recognition requires comprehensive risk management strategies across various domains.

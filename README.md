## Objective and Risk Analysis Pipeline
OpenAI’s reasoning model model series, currently including **o1-mini**, **o1** and **o3-mini**, are cutting-edge logic processing engines. Unlike standard language models, they're optimized to handle complex, multi-step challenges that go beyond simple text generation, offering enhanced capabilities for problem-solving and logical reasoning. Additionally, these models include built-in mechanisms ideal for risk analysis, helping to ensure more reliable and safe outputs in critical decision-making tasks. While OpenAI pioneered reasoning AI models, DeepSeek R1 is an open-source reasoning model that demonsrates comparative performance. 

The reasoning model series achieves this by optimizing the reasoning approach. Similarly to management consulting companies, these models break a problem down into smaller parts and "think" over a detailed approach. To come up with an optimized plan, these models can spend quite a bit of time achieving both an optimal approach and optimal outcome. Because these models can take many seconds (sometimes up to 35+ seconds) to return a reasoning answer, it does not make them ideal for real-time Generative AI scenarios like chat interfaces. However, these specific o1 models are ideal for business process workflows & pipelines where the better approach and outcome are sufficiently important.  

This repository includes a C# Console application that will orchestrate the following Risk Analysis Pipeline below:

## Risk Analysis Pipeline Details 

The pipeline in the repository performs Risk Analysis over SEC 10-K documents. In simple terms, the 10-K is a big report that gives investors a clear picture of how well a public company is doing. These reports must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) annually. Companies also have to disclose any potential risks they face in the 10-K, such as economic challenges, competition, legal issues, or changes in regulations. This helps investors understand what could go wrong with the company and how those risks might affect its future performance. These reports are typically analyzed by: investors, journalists, regulators, credit rating agencies, competitors etc. This makes a 10-K report ideal to validate if Generative AI advanced reasoning can be applied to risk analysis.  

* The following two Microsoft SEC 10-k Documents are used from 2023 and 2024. Links below illustrate the Risk Factors areas:  
  * 2023:  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017023035122/msft-20230630.htm#item_1a_risk_factors 
  * 2024:  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000095017024087843/msft-20240630.htm#item_1a_risk_factors

The image below illustrates how each Risk Factor section in the SEC 10-K documents is compared, analyzed by Generative AI. The identified differences are materialized as Markdown table files. This allows for experts to analyze the intermediate step and the workflow to begin from this state; bypassing the initial processing.  
![Risk Analysis Risk Factors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartczernicki/RiskAnalysisWithOpenAIReasoning/refs/heads/master/RiskAnalysisWithOpenAIReasoning/Images/RiskAnalysisWithOpenAIReasoning-RiskFactorSectionExample.png)  

Navigate to the Risk Factor Analysis Sections: https://github.com/bartczernicki/RiskAnalysisWithOpenAIReasoning/tree/master/RiskAnalysisWithOpenAIReasoning/Output/o1-preview  
Notice that each section contains several groups and certain risk factors do not change much (minor wording). An optimization would be to surface only the sufficiently important risk factor changes and persist the minor changes as intermediate steps. Therefore, in the next pipeline step, all of the generated 10-K Risk Factor sections are then consolidated into a single analysis that only surfaces the relevant risks into a single file. Examples of the single consolidated risk analysis are shown below for each respective o1 series model.  

> [!NOTE]
> Currently this application has "hard-coded" the SEC 10-K documents in a Data object. This was done to simplify and focus on the Generative AI risk analysis. There are many solutions like Azure Document Intelligence, that can provide the document segmantation to extract the **Risk Factor** sections dynamically.

Overall Next Steps:  
• Monitor & Review:  
 – Establish regular review cycles to assess the effectiveness of all mitigation strategies, incorporating changes in the risk landscape.  
 – Use performance metrics, key risk indicators, and internal audit feedback to adjust risk responses as necessary.  

• Integration & Communication:  
 – Ensure that risk management processes are integrated with overall strategic planning.  
 – Maintain clear, timely communication across all levels of the organization and with external stakeholders, ensuring transparency and agility in managing emerging risks.

By mapping each risk factor to the COSO ERM framework, Microsoft can ensure that risks are not viewed in isolation but rather as interconnected elements requiring coordinated governance, thorough risk assessments, proactive controls, and effective communication—thereby maintaining resilience in an increasingly complex risk environment.

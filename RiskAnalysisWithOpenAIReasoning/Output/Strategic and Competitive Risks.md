| 2   | Competition among platform-based ecosystems           | Importance of creating platform-based ecosystems with beneficial network effects; competition from vertically-integrated models in consumer products; challenges in attracting application developers and users to our platforms; efforts to compete may increase costs and reduce operating margins; competitors' rules may restrict distribution of products and services.                                                                                                                                                                   | Similar content; includes the same key points on competition from vertically-integrated models, competition from new devices affecting Windows licensing, challenges in attracting developers, and competitors' content/application marketplaces; adds a concluding paragraph highlighting potential inability to compete successfully and adverse effects on business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.                                              | Minor additions emphasizing potential inability to compete successfully and adverse effects on business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.                     |
| 3   | Business model competition                            | Competitors use a variety of business models: cloud services, AI investment, free applications funded by advertising, and open source software; we bear significant R&D costs; competitive pressures may cause decreased sales, price reductions, increased operating costs, lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Similar content; AI investment mentioned earlier and recognized as a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market with new competitors entering; added emphasis on being responsive to technological change, regulatory developments, and public scrutiny; competitive pressures may adversely affect financial condition and results of operations.                                                                                                                                                        | Reordered sub-points; greater emphasis on AI and cloud services; updated language on potential adverse effects on financial condition and results of operations.                        |
| 4   | Focus on cloud-based and AI services presents execution and competitive risks | Significant costs to build and maintain cloud infrastructure reduce operating margins; success depends on execution in bringing compelling cloud services to market, maintaining utility and compatibility across devices, enhancing cloud platforms' attractiveness to developers, ensuring reliability and security, and making services platform-agnostic; uncertainty in attracting users and generating revenue; failure may negatively impact gross margins and operating income; users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through cloud services, potentially impacting revenue and reputation. | Heading modified to include AI services explicitly; similar content but increased emphasis on AI throughout; highlights competitive and execution risks related to AI; emphasizes need to respond to technological change, regulatory developments, and public scrutiny; potential adverse effects on operations, financial condition, and results of operations if strategies fail; expanded discussion on risks of misuse of AI systems, unintended or inappropriate use, commitment to detecting misuse, potential reputational damage, and adverse impacts. | Heading modified to include AI; increased emphasis on AI throughout; more detailed risks related to AI; expanded section on risks of misuse of AI systems; potential adverse impacts highlighted. |

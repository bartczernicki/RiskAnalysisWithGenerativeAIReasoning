| Number | Risk Factor | Change | Potential Impact | Key Insights |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Security of our Information Technology | Modified to include incident‑specific details—explicitly citing a nation‑state password spray attack on a legacy test account and emphasizing sophisticated, evolving threat actor tactics. | Increases exposure to targeted cyberattacks, driving higher investments in advanced threat detection systems, rapid incident response measures, and stricter regulatory as well as insurance requirements. | Shifts the focus from generic cybersecurity concerns to a concrete, state‑sponsored threat scenario—highlighting the urgent need to fortify defenses and realign security strategies across the organization. |
| 2 | Development and Use of AI | Expanded to incorporate evolving regulatory frameworks (e.g., EU AI Act, U.S. AI Executive Order) and new copyright as well as ethical considerations. | May delay product launches and escalate legal/compliance costs, potentially impacting revenue streams, market positioning, and overall business strategy through increased regulatory and competitive challenges. | Transforms AI risk from a purely technical issue into a multifaceted strategic concern—highlighting intertwined regulatory, ethical, and competitive challenges that require cross‑functional oversight and proactive governance. |
| 3 | Catastrophic Events & Supply Chain Risks | Modified to integrate supply chain disruptions with catastrophic event risks by explicitly acknowledging that supply chain failures can compound the adverse impacts of natural disasters or other crises. | Could trigger severe operational delays and revenue losses, forcing significant capital investment in diversified logistics and robust business continuity planning to maintain competitiveness during crisis scenarios. | Emphasizes the interconnected nature of global risks and underscores the necessity for comprehensive, proactive contingency planning to mitigate the compound effects of environmental and supply chain vulnerabilities. |
| 4 | Data Privacy and Regulatory Compliance | Modified to underscore stricter enforcement actions—including active blocking of noncompliant services—and an updated, evolving regulatory landscape. | May result in increased compliance costs, legal fines, operational disruptions, and reputational damage if the company fails to swiftly adapt to the new privacy regimes in key international markets. | Reflects intensifying global regulatory scrutiny and highlights the urgency for agile, robust compliance frameworks and data governance measures to preempt emerging enforcement actions. |
| 5 | Reputation and Brand Damage | Expanded to include new triggers such as AI failures, missteps in corporate philanthropic initiatives, and enhanced cybersecurity incidents, in addition to traditional product-related issues. | Broadens the scope of reputational risk, potentially eroding customer trust, depressing market valuation, and necessitating costly crisis management and recovery initiatives that can affect long‑term brand strength. | Signals an evolving reputational landscape where both operational errors and strategic missteps now contribute to enduring brand erosion—emphasizing the need for proactive reputation management and crisis communication strategies. |
| 6 | Operations Infrastructure and Datacenter Risk | Modified by adding nontraditional dependencies (e.g., water supply) alongside traditional factors (power, networking) and emphasizing the impact of rising AI-driven demand. | Increases the risk of prolonged service disruptions and may require significant capital expenditure to bolster infrastructure resilience, thereby affecting operational continuity and overall financial performance. | Broadens the conventional view of infrastructure risks by recognizing the critical importance of peripheral resources—underscoring the need for more robust disaster recovery planning and comprehensive infrastructure modernization efforts. |

| 1      | Operations & Infrastructure Risk      | The 2024 filing now explicitly includes a dependency on water supply (in addition to power and connectivity) and broadens the impact to encompass overall business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.                    | This new inclusion exposes the company to environmental challenges such as drought and water scarcity, which could lead to service outages and operational disruptions. The broadened impact may affect not just financial statements but overall business continuity, necessitating enhanced contingency and risk management plans.                     | Highlighting water supply as a critical dependency reflects a proactive shift in risk recognition. It moves the company from a narrow view focused solely on power and connectivity to a broader operational risk framework that includes nontraditional infrastructure dependencies.                |
| 2      | Supply Chain & Component Availability Risk | The 2024 report emphasizes proactive initiatives—such as expanding datacenter locations and increasing server capacity—to address rising AI demand, while still cautioning about the risks posed by limited suppliers for critical components.        | By integrating proactive capacity expansion, the company aims to mitigate supply chain bottlenecks amid surging demand for AI services. However, persisting supplier constraints could still cause delays and increased operational costs, potentially impacting revenue and market competitiveness.                                                | The shift from a reactive to a proactive approach demonstrates strategic agility. The company is addressing emerging opportunities in AI while acknowledging that traditional supply vulnerabilities remain, thereby balancing innovation with risk management.                                       |
| 3      | Software Quality & Reliability Risk    | The 2024 disclosure broadens the risk scope by explicitly including potential issues arising from third-party product and service interdependencies, in addition to internal software defects.                                                   | Expanding the scope to include third-party interdependencies increases the complexity of risk management. Failures in external software components can cascade into broader operational disruptions, leading to customer dissatisfaction, higher remediation costs, and possible legal liabilities if defects are not promptly addressed.                         | Recognizing external dependencies underscores the interconnected nature of modern technology ecosystems. This change forces the company to enhance its oversight and vendor management processes to manage risks that extend beyond internally controlled systems.                             |
| 4      | Reputation and Brand Risk               | The 2024 summary now incorporates new dimensions—including risks from controversial corporate philanthropic initiatives and potential AI deployment failures—along with traditional concerns like data breaches and privacy issues.                     | Expanding the risk factors to include socio-political and ethical issues increases the scope of reputational risk. Missteps in AI governance or controversial philanthropic actions could erode public trust, trigger customer attrition, and negatively affect the company’s market position and financial performance.                             | The inclusion of socio-political elements in reputational risk signals a recognition that stakeholder perception now extends beyond technical and security issues. It necessitates more robust public engagement and proactive crisis management strategies.                                      |
| 5      | Catastrophic Events and IT Disruption Risk | The 2024 filing explicitly integrates supply chain disruptions into the list of catastrophic events that can affect IT systems, expanding the previously narrower focus on natural disasters, cyberattacks, and similar events.                         | This integration broadens the risk landscape, requiring the company to develop more comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Accounting for supply chain disruptions alongside traditional catastrophic events increases the vigilance needed across operations, potentially raising the costs and complexity of risk mitigation.        | Merging supply chain vulnerabilities with IT disruption risks emphasizes an integrated risk framework. It reflects an understanding that modern operational threats are interconnected and that robust, cross-functional risk management strategies are essential.                                |
| 6      | Management Cost Increases               | The risk factor concerning rising management costs identified in 2023 is no longer present in the 2024 filing, suggesting a consolidation or re-prioritization of risk disclosures.                                                               | The removal may indicate a strategic decision to absorb these concerns into broader operational or financial categories. While it reduces the number of explicitly stated risks, there is a potential risk that underlying management cost issues could be underreported, impacting ongoing oversight and performance monitoring.             | Eliminating this risk factor reflects a shift in risk disclosure strategy. Although streamlining risk factors can simplify reporting, it also requires stakeholders to ensure that previously critical cost management challenges are adequately monitored within other reported categories.           |

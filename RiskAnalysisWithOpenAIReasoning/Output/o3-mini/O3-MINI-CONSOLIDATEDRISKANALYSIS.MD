| 1      | Operations & Infrastructure Risk            | The 2024 filing now explicitly includes a dependency on water supply—alongside power and connectivity—and broadens the impact to overall business operations and financial condition.                                                  | Introducing water supply dependency exposes the company to environmental challenges such as drought or water scarcity, which can disrupt operations and financial stability, necessitating enhanced contingency and risk management plans.                                                                           | By recognizing nontraditional infrastructure dependencies, the company signals a strategic shift to a broader risk framework that safeguards its operational continuity in the face of environmental challenges.                                      |
| 2      | Supply Chain & Component Availability Risk   | The report emphasizes proactive initiatives—like expanding datacenter locations and increasing server capacity to meet rising AI demand—while still cautioning about persistent supplier limitations for critical components.             | While capacity expansion may ease some bottlenecks, continuing supplier constraints could cause delays, increase costs, and disrupt product delivery, potentially impacting revenue and market competitiveness.                                                                                                             | This change illustrates the company’s balancing act between seizing new opportunities in AI and managing longstanding supply vulnerabilities, highlighting its strategic agility amid evolving market demands.                                     |
| 3      | Reputation and Brand Risk                     | The 2024 summary expands risk factors to include new dimensions such as risks from controversial corporate philanthropic initiatives and potential AI deployment failures, in addition to traditional issues like data breaches.         | Broadening reputational risks to include socio-political and ethical dimensions can lead to eroded customer trust, negative media attention, and ultimately, adverse impacts on market share and profitability if mismanaged.                                                                                                | The inclusion of nontraditional factors underscores that reputation now hinges on both technical performance and broader stakeholder perceptions, prompting the need for comprehensive crisis management and proactive public engagement.         |
| 4      | Catastrophic Events and IT Disruption Risk    | The filing now integrates supply chain disruptions into the list of catastrophic events affecting IT systems—expanding the focus beyond natural disasters and cyberattacks to include operational bottlenecks.                        | This integration expands the risk landscape, demanding more robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans that address interdependent threats, which may increase complexity and cost while challenging rapid recovery during disruptions.                                                                       | By merging supply chain vulnerabilities with IT disruption risks, the change reflects a holistic view of modern operational threats and emphasizes the need for an integrated, cross‐functional risk management approach.                        |
| 5      | IT Security Risks                             | The 2024 update discloses a concrete incident—a nation-state password spray attack—and highlights that threat actors are now employing AI/ML techniques, underscoring challenges in rapid detection and response.                        | The disclosure of a real cybersecurity incident raises immediate concerns about the effectiveness of IT defenses, potentially leading to operational outages, regulatory scrutiny, and higher future investments in security measures.                                                                                  | Providing incident-specific details signals a more realistic and urgent approach to cybersecurity, with a focus on emerging, sophisticated, and technology-enabled threats that require rapid, coordinated responses.                         |
| 6      | Issues in the Development and Use of AI        | The AI risk narrative has been significantly expanded to include explicit legal, regulatory, and ethical concerns—such as potential liabilities under emerging frameworks like the EU AI Act and U.S. Executive Order, and broader societal impacts. | Expanding the AI risk scope increases exposure to legal liabilities, regulatory pressures, and reputational harm, while also heightening competitive risks if AI deployments lead to unintended ethical or operational consequences.                                                                                           | The detailed expansion emphasizes that AI is not only a key technological opportunity but also a complex risk area requiring robust oversight, regulatory compliance, and long-term strategic planning to manage its multifaceted impacts.       |

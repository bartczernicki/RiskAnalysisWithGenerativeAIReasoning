| 1   | Overall Competition Risk             | Microsoft faces intense competition across all markets for its products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Microsoft confronts intense competition across all markets for its products and services, which may adversely affect its results of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Wording has been slightly modified. In 2023 the focus was on impact to revenue and margins, while 2024 emphasizes broader operational results.                                                                                                                               |
| 2   | Technology Sector Competition        | Competitors in the technology sector range from large, diversified global companies to small, specialized innovators in rapidly evolving markets. Success depends on continuously creating innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to both businesses and consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Microsoft must consistently innovate to meet shifting user needs within a rapidly evolving technology sector. Failure to do so may harm its business, financial condition, and overall results of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The basic risk is unchanged, but 2024 adds an explicit warning that failure to innovate can adversely affect the company's financial condition and operational outcomes.                                               |
| 3   | Platform-Based Ecosystems Competition | Microsoft’s platform-based ecosystems face multi-faceted competitive pressures. Risks include: <br>• Competition from vertically integrated models (where competitors control both hardware and software), which may force margin reductions if Microsoft shifts to a similar approach. <br>• Windows licensing challenges as competing platforms for new devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) erode traditional PC revenue. <br>• Competition against content and application marketplaces that could hamper user and developer engagement. | Similar risks persist for Microsoft’s platform-based ecosystems. The company faces competition from vertically integrated models, challenges in licensing its Windows operating systems against emerging device platforms, and pressure from robust content and application marketplaces that could limit market scale and squeeze margins.                                                                                                                               | The 2024 disclosure mirrors the 2023 language with minor wording updates (e.g., replacing “phones” with “smartphones”) and a slight reordering. The overall risk profile in this domain remains comparable.           |
| 4   | Business Model Competition           | Microsoft competes using a mix of license-based proprietary software and emerging service-based models. It incurs significant R&D and operational costs while facing competition from: <br>• Traditional software competitors <br>• Firms offering free applications, online services, and advertising-supported content <br>• Companies leveraging open source software that mimic Microsoft features.                                                                                                                              | Business model competition now explicitly includes multiple revenue streams: <br>• A material emphasis on cloud-based services across diverse devices <br>• Substantial investments in AI capabilities amid rapidly evolving competitive pressures <br>• Continued reliance on the legacy license-based model alongside competition from free apps, advertising-supported services, and open source offerings.                                                                                                       | In 2024 the risk factor is modified to incorporate an explicit acknowledgment of cloud-based services as a core business component and recognizes evolving challenges in the AI space, complementing the traditional license-based model. |
| 5   | Cloud and AI Services Execution Risks | As Microsoft increases its focus on cloud-based services, it faces execution risks that include: <br>• Significant infrastructure and development costs <br>• The challenge of delivering compelling, compatible, and secure cloud experiences across various devices (PCs, tablets, smartphones, gaming consoles, IoT endpoints) <br>• Risks related to fraudulent or abusive activities that may undermine service integrity and customer trust.                                                                         | The risk now extends to both cloud-based and AI services. Key concerns include: <br>• Rising infrastructure and operational costs to support increasingly complex cloud and AI platforms <br>• The challenge of ensuring high performance, security, and cross-device compatibility for these services <br>• Potential misuse of powerful AI systems alongside issues like fraud, unauthorized access, and other abusive activities that may harm reputation or financial performance. | Compared to 2023, 2024 broadens the scope by explicitly including AI services. The language emphasizes the dual challenges of managing both cloud and AI systems while addressing evolving security, reliability, and compliance issues.                                                       |

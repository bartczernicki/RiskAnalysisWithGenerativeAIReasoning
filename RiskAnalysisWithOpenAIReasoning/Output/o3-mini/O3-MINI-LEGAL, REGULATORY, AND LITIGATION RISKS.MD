| 1          | Operations Infrastructure and Outages | Outlines the risk of service outages, data losses, and disruptions if the operations infrastructure is not robust enough. It emphasizes the increasing computing demands from growing user traffic, product complexity, and the integration of new and AI-enhanced services, while depending on critical inputs such as land, energy, and networking components. | Presents a similar risk regarding outages, data loss, and disruptions due to infrastructure challenges. The 2024 filing adds mention of dependencies on reliable power and water supply and continues to stress the demands of AI integration and third-party hosting, highlighting evolving regulatory and competitive constraints. | **Modified:** The core concern remains the same but the 2024 version adds details (e.g., water supply dependency) and emphasizes evolving operational challenges amid AI and third-party service integration.                                    |
| 2          | Software Quality and Reliability      | Highlights potential issues with software bugs and defects that could disrupt critical business functions, lead to delays in product releases, and incur repair, remediation, or legal liabilities, even though contractual provisions may limit exposure.                                                                                                               | Identifies similar risks from software defects, but expands the discussion to include the impact of interdependencies with third-party products and services. This interconnection magnifies the potential effect of reliability issues on business operations and financial outcomes.                                                                   | **Modified:** While both years address software defects, the 2024 filing deepens the narrative by stressing third-party interdependencies and the broader impact on business and financial conditions.                                         |
| 3          | Hardware Product Quality              | Addresses risks related to hardware quality problems in products like Xbox consoles and Surface devices. Defects in design, manufacture, or related software may lead to recalls, safety alerts, and product liability claims, thereby harming reputation and financial performance.                                                                  | Focuses on the inherent complexity of hardware products. It states that defects—whether in design, manufacturing, or associated software—could result in recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, adversely affecting business outcomes.                                                                                                   | **Modified:** Although the risk is fundamentally the same, the 2024 version reorders the presentation and clarifies that defects in hardware can directly lead to recalls and liability claims impacting overall business results.                 |
| 4          | Supply Chain and Limited Suppliers      | Discusses the risk stemming from having limited suppliers for key datacenter components and devices. Supplier constraints, industry shortages, or geopolitical and regulatory changes could delay component replacement, reduce sales, or limit datacenter capacity—affecting revenue and operational efficiency.              | Describes similar concerns over limited supplier availability for both device and datacenter components. However, the 2024 filing highlights proactive efforts to expand datacenter locations and server capacity to address growing AI service demand, while still acknowledging competitive pressures and supply chain disruptions.               | **Modified:** The risk remains centered on supply chain limitations, but 2024 shifts part of the focus to strategic expansion of datacenter capacity in response to increased AI demand, along with the traditional supply constraints.              |

| 1   | Competition in Technology Sector           | Intense competition from diversified global companies and specialized firms requiring continual innovation to maintain revenue and margins.                                                                      | Similar intense competition with explicit language about the need to keep innovating to remain competitive, highlighting potential adverse effects on overall business, financial condition, and operating results.         | Largely consistent in theme; wording shifted to emphasize broader financial impacts rather than just revenue/margins.                                                     |
| 2   | Platform-Based Ecosystem Competition      | Risks related to competing platform ecosystems—including vertically integrated models, Windows OS licensing challenges, and difficulties in attracting developers—with implications for margins and OEM relationships. | Similar risks from competing ecosystems with updated references (e.g., inclusion of smartphones and tablets), continued challenges in developer engagement and OEM relationships, and competitive pressures from integrated platforms. | Minor modifications reflecting updated device categories and market examples; overall themes remain consistent.                                                          |
| 3   | Business Model Competition & AI Investment | Challenges arising from competing business models, including the reliance on the traditional license-based software model, significant R&D expenditures, and emerging investments in AI, free services, and open source alternatives. | Maintains the traditional licensing competition while placing enhanced emphasis on substantial investments in cloud-based services and AI, noting new market entrants and rapid evolution in these areas.              | Expanded emphasis on cloud and AI, with a clearer nod to the fast-changing competitive landscape and new entrants, while still accounting for the traditional software licensing risks. |
| 4   | Cloud and AI Services Execution & Fraud Risks | Execution risks from the increasing focus on cloud-based services, including high infrastructure costs, challenges across multiple devices, uncertainties in market adoption, and vulnerabilities to fraudulent or abusive activities. | Similar execution risks now broadened to include AI services as well as cloud, with additional details on performance, reliability, compliance challenges across various devices, and continued concerns about fraud and misuse. | Broadened scope to explicitly incorporate AI alongside cloud, with more detailed discussion of execution challenges, compliance requirements, and reputational risks from misuse.                  |

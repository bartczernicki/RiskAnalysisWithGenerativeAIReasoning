| 1 | Operations Infrastructure & Service Disruptions | Microsoft faces risks of excessive outages, data loss, and service disruptions driven by increased user traffic, growing service complexity, and heavy reliance on datacenter infrastructure. This risk factor emphasizes the need for substantial investments in acquiring and upgrading datacenters, securing resources (land, energy, networking, and key components like GPUs), and the potential for operational failures (loss of data, power issues, connectivity problems) that could hurt reputation and financials. | The core risk remains similar—with potential outages, data losses, and disruptions due to increased user traffic and complex products—but the 2024 text adds the risk of inadequate water supply and more explicitly links these interruptions to adverse impacts on business operations, financial condition, and overall results. Additionally, there is an emerging emphasis on the intensified demands from incorporating AI features. | Modified: While the core concerns about infrastructure reliability remain, the 2024 filing expands the scope to include additional resource risks (e.g., water supply) and more explicitly underscores the broader operational and financial repercussions.                                                                                                                                                |
| 2 | Supply Chain and Component Availability           | Microsoft highlights quality and supply problems related to a limited pool of suppliers for devices and datacenter components. The risk includes supply chain disruptions, industry shortages, and delays that could adversely affect the availability of critical components (used in Xbox consoles, Surface devices, servers, etc.), potentially reducing sales and impairing datacenter capacity.                                                       | The 2024 discussion continues to stress risks from a limited supplier base and shortages of key components but adds a forward-looking focus on expanding datacenter locations and increasing server capacity—especially in light of growing AI service demand. The emphasis is on maintaining timely supplies amid competitive pressures and geopolitical disruptions.                                                                                                     | Modified: The risk of component supply issues is retained, but the narrative now includes proactive measures (expansion of datacenter capacity) and a focus on the emerging demand from AI services. Notably, the discussion of hardware product defects is removed from this section in favor of a more focused treatment.                                                                        |
| 3 | Software Quality and Reliability                   | There is a risk that Microsoft's sophisticated software could contain bugs or defects, especially as multiple products and services become interdependent. Any undetected issues can lead to reduced sales, reputation damage, costly repairs or remediation, delays in new releases, and potential legal liability, despite contractual liability limitations.                                                               | The 2024 filing similarly details risks of quality and reliability issues in software products, noting that undetected bugs or defects could have cascading effects. However, it further emphasizes that interdependencies now extend to interactions with third-party products and services, broadening the scope of potential impact on business, operational efficiency, and financial results.                                                             | Modified: The risk remains centered on software defects, but the 2024 version explicitly incorporates the impact of third-party dependencies, thereby widening the range of potential disruptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4 | Hardware Product Defects and Liability             | In 2023, risks related to hardware quality were discussed within the broader "quality or supply problems" category. This included the possibility that complex hardware (such as Xbox consoles and Surface devices) could suffer from design, manufacturing, or software defects, leading to recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims with significant financial and reputational implications.                         | In 2024, hardware product risks are presented as a distinct factor. Microsoft underscores that its complex devices (Xbox, Surface, etc.) face the possibility of defects in design, manufacturing, or associated software, which—if not addressed—could trigger recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims that would adversely affect business operations and financial performance.                                                           | New Separation: Whereas 2023 incorporated hardware defects within a broader risk factor, 2024 separates this issue into its own distinct category for greater clarity and focus on the potential liabilities associated with hardware product defects.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 1   | Reputation and Brand Damage                 | Damage to reputation/brands from unpopular product features or changes, privacy/data issues, security breaches, compliance failures, or negative public scrutiny amplified by social media—which could hurt revenues, margins, and talent attraction.                                                                 | Similar risks where damage to reputation/brands may arise from unpopular product changes and scrutiny over privacy, data practices, or breach events—but now also includes potential backlash over corporate philanthropic initiatives, as well as risks related to AI development, deployment, and responsible AI failures. | Modified – Expanded to include corporate philanthropic initiatives and AI-related issues (development, deployment, and responsible AI failures).                                                          |
| 2   | Adverse Economic/Market Conditions          | Worsening economic conditions—including inflation, recession, pandemic or market slowdowns—could reduce IT spending and dampen demand for PCs, servers, and related products, thereby adversely affecting revenue.                                                                                              | Similar concerns that deteriorating economic conditions (inflation, recession, pandemic, etc.) may lower IT spending and negatively impact the company’s overall results of operations.                                                                                                                                                           | Largely unchanged; only minor wording differences.                                                                                                                      |
| 3   | Product Distribution System                 | Reliance on an extensive partner and retail network (including OEMs) for the distribution of software and related products; disruptions among partners (e.g. bankruptcy of a distributor) could harm sales channels.                                                                                          | Continues to rely on its partner and OEM network for distribution with similar risks of channel disruption if partners are impacted by adverse economic conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                  | No material changes.                                                                                                                                 |
| 4   | Customer Payment and Credit Risk            | Economic challenges may impair customers’ abilities to pay for products/services, leading to increased allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of receivables.                                                                                                                                          | Identical risk: economic downturns may similarly impair customer payment abilities, resulting in increased allowances for doubtful account provisions and write-offs.                                                                                                                                                                             | No material changes.                                                                                                                                 |
| 5   | Investment Portfolio Risk                   | The firm’s diverse investment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks; global financial downturns or a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating could force impairment charges that negatively affect consolidated financial statements.                         | The company’s investments face similar credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks; prolonged downturns or rating downgrades might lead to impairment charges adversely affecting its financial condition and results of operations.                                                                                                        | Minor wording adjustments regarding the financial impact.                                                                                                               |
| 6   | Catastrophic Events and Business Disruption | Catastrophic events (e.g., earthquakes, severe weather, cyberattacks, terrorist attacks, pandemics) can disrupt critical business and IT systems—especially given the concentration of operations in seismically active regions—and delay service delivery, particularly for cloud-based offerings.             | Similar risks from catastrophic events threaten disruptions in systems, operations, or even supply chains; there is added emphasis on the potential negative consequences of prolonged service outages in its cloud services footprint.                                                                                                             | Modified – Added explicit reference to supply chain disruptions and stressed the impact of prolonged outages.                                                             |
| 7   | Geopolitical and Political Risks            | Abrupt political changes, terrorism, or armed conflict (e.g., in Ukraine) might disrupt operations, raise costs, impair sales and collections, and result in sanctions or changing regulatory environments.                                                                                                  | Similar risks from geopolitical instability and political changes (including events like the conflict in Ukraine) that may disrupt markets, elevate costs, or otherwise interfere with operations and regulatory compliance.                                                                                                                           | Minor wording modifications; overall risk implications remain similar.                                                                                                  |
| 8   | Global Pandemic/Epidemic Risk               | Regional epidemics or a global pandemic (e.g., COVID-19) may adversely impact business operations, financial condition, and overall results, depending on duration, scope, and response measures.                                                                                                             | Likewise, the occurrence of pandemics or epidemics could adversely affect business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations—with the impact contingent on factors such as duration, scope, and responses by governments and businesses.                                                                                            | Largely unchanged; slight wording update (addition of “business” alongside “operations”).                                                                               |
| 9   | Climate Change Impact                        | Uncertain long-term effects of climate change may raise costs related to powering and cooling computer hardware used in product development and cloud services; evolving environmental regulations and resource availability also pose risks.                                                               | Similar long-term climate risks exist, with an expanded discussion that not only notes rising costs for powering and cooling hardware but also addresses changes in the supply, demand, and available sources of energy and other resources affecting business operations.                                                                          | Modified – Expanded to include broader considerations of energy/resource supply and demand.                                                                             |
| 10  | Global Business and International Risks      | The company’s global operations expose it to economic, monetary, political, and trade risks—including currency fluctuations, emerging nationalist/protectionist pressures, and difficulties managing operations in diverse markets—which can adversely affect revenue.                                     | Global exposure continues to subject the company to similar economic, political, and regulatory risks, with an added emphasis on challenges within its international growth strategy and the impacts of currency fluctuations on its results of operations.                                                                                        | Largely unchanged; slight elaboration on international growth challenges and consistent currency risk factors.                                                          |
| 11  | Talent Attraction and Retention              | Success depends on attracting and retaining diverse, highly skilled employees in a competitive market; immigration restrictions and unionization trends could further complicate recruitment and retention, potentially affecting product and service delivery.                                     | The focus remains on attracting, training, and retaining a diverse set of talented employees; the 2024 filing adds an emphasis on employee development and fostering an inclusive work environment, while continuing to mention challenges from restrictive immigration laws and unionization trends.                                             | Modified – Expanded to include “training” and a greater emphasis on a thriving, inclusive work environment.                                                             |
| 12  | Increased Costs for Risk Management          | The company noted that it might incur increased costs to manage these diverse risk areas, with failure potentially impacting revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation.                                                                                                                 | This standalone mention of incurring increased costs for managing business risks was not explicitly included in the 2024 filing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Removed – The explicit risk factor regarding increased management costs is absent from the 2024 filing.                                                                    |

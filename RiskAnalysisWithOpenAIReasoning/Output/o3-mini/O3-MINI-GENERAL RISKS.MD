| 5   | Investment Portfolio Risk                       | Explains that Microsoft’s investment portfolio—subject to credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks—could suffer impairments (affecting consolidated financial statements) if global financial markets decline or if there is a downgrade in the U.S. government credit rating.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | States that similar risks exist for the investment portfolio, with market downturns or credit downgrades potentially resulting in a decline in fair value.

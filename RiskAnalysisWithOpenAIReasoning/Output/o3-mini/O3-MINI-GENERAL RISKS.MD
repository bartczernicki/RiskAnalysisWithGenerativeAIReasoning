|------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Reputation and Brand Risk          | Risks that damage to Microsoft’s globally recognized reputation or brands—stemming from product changes, customer/user or partner backlash, data practices, privacy issues, supply chain, environmental, or human rights concerns—could harm revenues, margins, and talent attraction. | Similar risks remain; however, the 2024 filing expands the scope by including potential backlash related to corporate philanthropic initiatives and to the development, deployment, and even potential failures related to AI.  | **Modified:** Expanded to incorporate AI-related issues and corporate philanthropic initiatives, adding new dimensions to the risk.                      |
| 2          | Adverse Economic Conditions        | Economic downturns—including inflation, recession, or pandemics—that reduce IT spending and demand for computing devices, adversely affecting revenue.                                  | Similar concerns are expressed, with adverse economic conditions potentially impacting IT spending and the overall results of operations.                                                                                 | **Minor Rewording:** No substantive change; language now emphasizes “results of operations” in addition to revenue impacts.                               |
| 3          | Product Distribution Risk          | Reliance on an extensive partner and retail network (including OEMs) poses risks if economic challenges among partners cause distribution or channel disruptions.                   | The risk remains essentially the same, highlighting exposure to disruptions in partner and retail networks that help distribute Microsoft’s software and devices.                                                        | **Unchanged:** The basic exposure through the distribution network remains consistent.                                                                   |
| 4          | Customer Payment and Credit Risk   | Challenging economic conditions may impair customers’ ability to pay for products/services, leading to increased allowances for doubtful accounts and potential write-offs.       | An analogous risk is noted regarding customers’ payment challenges, which could similarly elevate allowances for doubtful accounts and trigger receivables write-offs.                                                  | **Unchanged:** The risk continues to be described similarly across both filings.                                                                        |
| 5          | Investment Portfolio Risk          | Investments—including a significant portion in U.S. government securities—are exposed to credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks; declines in markets or ratings may necessitate impairments affecting consolidated financial statements. | The portfolio faces similar risks with language updated to stress potential adverse impacts on Microsoft’s financial condition and results of operations.                                                            | **Minor Wording Update:** Emphasis shifted slightly from consolidated financial statements to overall financial condition and operational results.       |
| 6          | Catastrophic Events & IT/System Risk | Catastrophic events (e.g., natural disasters, cyberattacks, pandemics) that disrupt key business locations or IT systems could delay sales, impair operations, and affect cloud services. | The 2024 version mirrors these concerns but adds explicit reference to disruptions in the supply chain and underscores the negative impact of prolonged service outages on results of operations.                     | **Modified:** Expanded to include supply chain disruptions and a greater focus on the continuity of service in the cloud.                                 |
| 7          | Geopolitical and Political Risks   | Abrupt political changes, terrorism, and conflicts (such as the conflict in Ukraine) risk economic disruption, supply chain issues, increased operating costs, and impaired collections. | Similar geopolitical risks are highlighted, noting that political instability—including terrorism and conflict—can disrupt sales, collections, and raise operating costs in affected markets.                         | **Unchanged:** The risks are fundamentally the same, with only minor phrasing updates.                                                                  |
| 8          | Pandemic and Epidemic Impact       | Regional epidemics or a global pandemic (e.g., COVID-19) may adversely affect operations, financial condition, and revenue, with impacts depending on the pandemic’s duration and scope. | The 2024 filing frames pandemic risks similarly, noting that such events can adversely affect the business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.                                              | **Minor Wording Differences:** Slight expansion to include “business” impact beyond operational or financial conditions.                                 |
| 9          | Climate Change and Environmental Risks | Uncertain long-term effects of climate change and evolving environmental regulations may increase costs (e.g., powering and cooling computer hardware) and disrupt operations.     | The risk is described much the same way, with continued uncertainty about climate change impacts and potential cost increases associated with environmental challenges.                                             | **Unchanged:** The underlying risk remains consistently presented across both years.                                                                     |
| 10         | Global Business and Market Risks   | Operating globally exposes Microsoft to international economic, operational, and geopolitical risks—including currency fluctuations, trade policy changes, and challenges in emerging markets—that can affect revenue. | The 2024 discussion of global risks parallels the 2023 view, emphasizing that economic developments, political disputes, and trade policy shifts in international markets can adversely affect overall results of operations. | **Unchanged:** Essentially the same exposure is discussed, with only minor language tweaks regarding market impact.                                       |
| 11         | Talent Attraction and Retention Risk | Microsoft’s success depends on attracting and retaining a highly skilled, diverse workforce in a competitive market, with challenges including immigration restrictions and potential unionization impacts. | The 2024 filing maintains similar concerns but adds an emphasis on employee training along with recruiting and retention, and it updates language about immigration policy constraints affecting the flow of technical talent. | **Slight Modification:** Added focus on training and updated the discussion on immigration-related talent restrictions.                                   |

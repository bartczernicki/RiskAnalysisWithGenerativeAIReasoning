| 1          | Reputation & Brand Risk                | Damage to reputation/brands from product safety/quality issues, environmental/sustainability concerns, supply chain practices, human rights records, and data security breaches—with negative impacts amplified by social media.                                                                     | Similar risk of reputational damage, but now also includes backlash related to corporate philanthropic initiatives, the development and deployment of AI (and associated responsible AI failures), in addition to the preexisting concerns.                                                                           | **Modified:** Expanded scope to include AI-related issues and corporate philanthropic initiatives while maintaining the core reputation risk.                                                                               |
| 2          | Economic/Market Conditions             | Worsening economic conditions (inflation, recession, pandemic) may lower IT spending and revenue from products like PCs, servers, and other computing devices, potentially harming operating results.                                                                                              | Adverse economic conditions—including inflation, recession, and pandemic effects—continue to adversely impact IT spending and the company’s results of operations.                                                                                                                                              | **Minimal Change:** The description is largely similar; only slight wording updates (e.g., “operating results” to “results of operations”).                                                                                   |
| 3          | Distribution Network Risk              | Dependence on an extensive partner and retail network where economic distress (like the bankruptcy of distributors, OEMs, or retailers) could disrupt the sales channel.                                                                                                                            | Continued reliance on a broad partner and retail network with the risk that economic challenges among partners could result in sales channel disruptions.                                                                                                                                                           | **Minor Rewording:** The risk remains essentially the same in both reports.                                                                                                            |
| 4          | Customer Payment Risk                  | Challenging economic conditions may impair customers’ ability to pay for products and services, leading to increased allowances for doubtful accounts and potential write-offs.                                                                                                                   | Similar risk where tough economic conditions hinder customers’ payment ability for purchased products and services.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Slight Wording Differences:** The core risk of customer payment impairments is maintained.                                                                                          |
| 5          | Investment Portfolio Risk              | The investment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks—with a significant holding in U.S. government securities; a market downturn or U.S. credit downgrade could force impairment charges that affect consolidated financial statements.                          | The portfolio remains exposed to similar risks. A downturn or a downgrade in U.S. government credit could trigger impairment charges that adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations.                                                                                         | **Wording Refinement:** “Consolidated financial statements” in 2023 is updated to “financial condition and results of operations” in 2024, with the overall risk remaining unchanged.                                          |
| 6          | Catastrophic Events & IT Disruption    | Catastrophic events (natural disasters, cyberattacks, terrorist attacks, pandemics) could disrupt critical business functions and IT systems, especially given the geographic concentration in seismically active regions and the reliance on cloud services.                                      | Similar risk where catastrophic events—including natural disasters, cyberattacks, terrorist incidents, and now explicitly supply chain disruptions—could delay sales and critical functions by impacting IT systems and operations.                                                                             | **Minor Modifications:** Inclusion of supply chain disruptions while the fundamental risk remains consistent.                                                                                                              |
| 7          | Political & Geopolitical Risks         | Abrupt political change, terrorism, and armed conflict (e.g., the conflict in Ukraine) may cause economic disruption, increase operating costs, and hinder the ability to sell and collect from customers in affected markets.                                                                   | Abrupt political change, terrorism, and armed conflict (again, notably referencing Ukraine) continue to pose economic and operational risks that could affect sales, increase costs, and disrupt business in both directly and indirectly impacted markets.                                                     | **Largely Unchanged:** Only slight phrasing differences with the core geopolitical risk remaining intact.                                                                                                                   |
| 8          | Pandemic Risk                          | Regional epidemics or a global pandemic (such as COVID-19) could adversely affect operations, financial condition, and overall revenue, depending on its duration, scope, and the effectiveness of mitigation measures.                                                                       | Global pandemics (e.g., COVID-19) continue to threaten the business by potentially impacting operations, financial condition, and results of operations, with outcomes largely contingent on the scope and responses taken by governments and businesses.                                                   | **Essentially the Same:** Minimal wording updates with no substantial change in the identified risk.                                                                                                                         |
| 9          | Management Cost Increases              | Increased costs to manage these diverse business risks (e.g., reputation, economic challenges, etc.) could negatively impact revenues, cash flows, market share, and reputation if not effectively contained.                                                                                   | *(Not Present)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Removed:** This separate risk factor is no longer identified in the 2024 filing, suggesting a possible consolidation or re-prioritization of risk disclosures.                                                              |
| 10         | Climate Change Impact                  | Uncertainty about the long-term effects of climate change—including environmental regulation and changes in energy/resource supply—could increase costs (e.g., for powering and cooling computer hardware) and affect resource availability.                                               | Similar concerns remain, with the long-term effects of climate change and shifts in environmental regulations or energy supply/demand potentially affecting the cost and availability of resources critical to operations.                                                                                   | **Essentially Unchanged:** Only minor consolidation in wording; the fundamental risk theme remains consistent.                                                                                                              |
| 11         | Global Business & Operational Risks    | Operating globally exposes the company to international economic and operational risks such as market fluctuations, trade policy changes, protectionist measures, and currency volatility, which may impact international sales and overall operations.                                       | The global business continues to face risks from international market developments, trade policy shifts (including higher tariffs, export controls), geopolitical tensions, and significant foreign exchange fluctuations that could affect operations and profitability.                                      | **Slightly Reworded:** Expanded examples (e.g., tariffs, export controls) but the core exposure to global economic and operational risks remains the same.                                                                  |
| 12         | Talent & Workforce Risk                | The success of the business hinges on attracting and retaining a diverse, highly skilled workforce in a competitive market—challenges include restrictive immigration laws and potential unionization, which may complicate staffing and increase operational costs.                        | Equally critical is attracting, training, and retaining top talent; the discussion now more explicitly addresses the impact of changes to U.S. immigration policies and unionization risks on staffing, particularly within research and development functions.                                              | **Modified:** Added emphasis on training, detailed mention of immigration policy changes, and a clearer link to R&D staffing challenges, while the overall risk remains centered on talent acquisition and retention.       |

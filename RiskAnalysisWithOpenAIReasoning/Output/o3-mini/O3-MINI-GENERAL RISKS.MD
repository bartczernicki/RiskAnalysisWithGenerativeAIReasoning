| 1 | Reputation and Brand Damage                | Emphasizes that damage to Microsoft’s globally recognized reputation or brands—through product safety/quality issues, environmental impact, supply chain practices, human rights concerns, unpopular product features, scrutiny over user privacy/data practices, or security breaches—could harm revenues, margins, and talent attraction.                                                                                                             | Covers similar risks to reputation and brands but expands the scope by including backlash tied to corporate philanthropic initiatives and concerns over the development and deployment of AI. It also adds explicit references to responsible AI failures and cybersecurity incidents as potential catalysts for reputational harm.                                                                                            | **Modified.** The 2024 version broadens the scope by adding AI-related risks (both in development/deployment and responsible AI failures) and including corporate philanthropic initiatives in the list of potential reputational risks, as well as explicitly mentioning cybersecurity incidents.                                                                                                                             |
| 2 | Adverse Economic and Market Conditions     | Details how worsening economic conditions (such as inflation, recession, pandemics, or decreases in IT spending) can adversely affect revenue. It also highlights risks from disruptions in sales channels—like OEM and retail partner challenges—and the increased likelihood of customer payment issues leading to higher doubtful accounts and write-offs.                                                                             | Presents essentially the same risk factor with adverse economic or market conditions (including inflation, recession, and pandemics) potentially leading to decreased IT spending and negative impacts on results of operations. It similarly warns that disruptions in partner channels and customer payment challenges could affect overall operations.                                                     | **Modified minimally.** The language has been updated (e.g., shifting from “business” to “results of operations”) but the underlying risk stemming from adverse economic conditions and related channel/payment concerns remains the same.                                                                                                                              |
| 3 | Investment Portfolio Risk                  | Focuses on the risks associated with Microsoft’s investment portfolio—which largely comprises U.S. government securities—and how credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks (especially in the event of prolonged financial downturns or a downgrade in U.S. government credit) could lead to impairment charges that negatively impact consolidated financial statements.                                                   | Largely mirrors the 2023 risk by underlining similar risks in its investment portfolio. However, it now emphasizes that prolonged financial market declines or a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating could lead to a decline in fair value of investments, thereby affecting the company’s financial condition and results of operations.                                                         | **Modified.** The updated language in 2024 shifts the emphasis from solely impacting consolidated financial statements to also affecting overall financial condition and results of operations, with a slightly expanded explanation of potential fair value declines.                                                                                                           |
| 4 | Catastrophic Events and Geopolitical Risks  | Describes potential disruptions from catastrophic events—such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, terrorist incidents, pandemics, or other disruptions—in key seismically active regions (like Seattle and Silicon Valley). It also highlights how geopolitical events (e.g., political changes or conflicts like in Ukraine) can increase operating costs, disrupt sales channels, and negatively impact financial results.                           | Maintains a similar focus on disruptions from catastrophic events and geopolitical conditions but explicitly incorporates the risk of supply chain disruptions. It emphasizes that failures in critical IT systems, including those supporting cloud services, can adversely affect the company’s ability to operate normally and harm its results of operations.                                        | **Modified.** The 2024 filing adds the potential for supply chain disruptions in catastrophic events and more clearly ties system failures—especially in the context of increased cloud service reliance—to negative impacts on results of operations.                                                                                                                                |
| 5 | Pandemic and Epidemic Risks                | Highlights the possibility that regional epidemics or global pandemics (such as COVID-19) could adversely affect operations, financial condition, and overall results. The impact depends on factors such as the duration and severity of the event along with governmental and market responses, which might also intensify other existing risks.                                                             | Essentially mirrors the 2023 discussion by noting that the outbreak of regional or global pandemics (including COVID-19) may have adverse effects on business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The outcome will depend on similar factors like duration, governmental and individual responses, and associated economic impacts.                                         | **Modified minimally.** The wording in 2024 has been slightly updated (e.g., referencing “business” and “results of operations”) without changing the underlying risk outlook.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 6 | Climate Change and Environmental Risks     | Points to the long-term uncertainty regarding climate change’s effects on the global economy and the IT industry, including potential changes in environmental regulations or resource availability. It also notes that climate change may drive up the costs of powering and cooling the hardware essential for software development and cloud services.                                       | Reiterates the same risk by emphasizing that the unclear long-term effects of climate change, alongside potential shifts in environmental regulations and resource availability, could impact the costs of running the business—particularly regarding the powering and cooling of computer hardware for software and cloud-based services.                                                     | **No substantive change.** The 2024 version essentially reflects the 2023 risk factor with only minor rewording.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 7 | Global Business and International Risks    | Discusses the risks related to Microsoft’s extensive global operations, including exposure to varying economic, political, and military conditions worldwide. It mentions that changes in trade policies, currency fluctuations, and emerging nationalist and protectionist trends can disrupt international sales and increase operating costs.                                                | Covers similar ground by noting that global and regional economic developments, political disputes, and regulatory changes can adversely affect results of operations. This version adds concerns regarding human rights, environmental, and political expression issues and introduces the idea of non-local sourcing restrictions as additional facets of international risk. | **Modified.** The 2024 risk factor expands on the international risks by including concerns related to human rights, environmental impacts, and political expression, and it introduces non-local sourcing restrictions, though the fundamental risk of global exposure remains consistent.                                                                              |
| 8 | Talent and Workforce Risks                 | Emphasizes the necessity of attracting and retaining a diverse, highly skilled workforce to maintain innovation and operational success. It notes the competitive market for talent, challenges posed by restrictive immigration policies, and the risks associated with unionization, which could increase costs and limit operational flexibility.                              | Similar in scope, the 2024 risk factor stresses the importance of attracting, training, and retaining talent. It places additional emphasis on the impact of changes to U.S. immigration policies on the flow of technical professionals, underscores the need for effective succession planning, and reiterates the potential challenges posed by unionization.                | **Modified.** While the core concern remains the same, the 2024 version includes added language on training, a more explicit discussion of evolving U.S. immigration policies, and a reinforced mention of succession planning, reflecting a broader approach to managing talent-related risks.                                                                                      |

| 1   | Competition in the Technology Sector            | Microsoft faces intense competition across all product and service markets, driven by rapid technological change, low entry barriers, and evolving customer needs. Success depends on continuous innovation to appeal to both businesses and consumers, with competitive pressures potentially lowering revenue and margins.                                                                                                                                        | The company similarly emphasizes intense competition across all markets. The focus remains on the need to innovate to stay competitive, but the language now highlights the risk of adversely affecting the company’s overall results of operations if competitive challenges are not met.                                                                                                        | Largely similar in scope and content; the language has been slightly updated—from concerns about lower revenue or operating margins in 2023 to a more comprehensive risk of adverse impacts on overall results of operations in 2024.                                                                                                        |
| 2   | Competition Among Platform-Based Ecosystems      | Microsoft discusses risks from competing platform ecosystems, including: <br>• The challenge posed by vertically integrated competitors (combining hardware, software, and related services) which may gain security and performance advantage. <br>• Competitive pressures on its Windows OS licensing revenue from new devices and form factors. <br>• The importance of maintaining an attractive ecosystem for developers amid established marketplaces with network effects. | The discussion remains focused on platform-based ecosystem competition. The 2024 version similarly details risks from vertically integrated models, challenges related to Windows OS competition from smartphones, tablets, and other devices, and the difficulties in competing with large-scale content and application marketplaces.                                                                             | Essentially the same risk factor with minor wording updates. The 2024 version reaffirms the risks while updating examples (e.g., explicitly mentioning smartphones) and emphasizing potential adverse effects on margins and overall business performance.                                                                                |
| 3   | Business Model Competition                        | Microsoft highlights challenges arising from different business models, including the traditional license-based proprietary software model versus emerging cloud-based and AI-driven services. It notes that investments in R&D—including in AI capabilities—are significant, and that competition also comes from providers of free applications, online services financed through advertising, and open source solutions.                   | The 2024 filing maintains the discussion on business model competition with a similar breakdown. However, there is an increased emphasis on the role of cloud-based services and AI investments. New market entrants in the AI space and the evolving nature of subscription and traditional licensing models are noted as key competitive challenges.                                                       | The risk factor is modified to integrate a greater focus on the evolving cloud and AI markets. The 2024 text explicitly acknowledges new competitors in AI and reinforces the continuing importance of both traditional and subscription-based models.                                                                                     |
| 4   | Cloud-Based and AI Services Execution Risks       | As Microsoft increases its focus on cloud-based services, it outlines several execution risks: the challenge of delivering compelling cloud experiences, ensuring compatibility across a wide range of devices, managing significant infrastructure costs, and mitigating fraud and abuse (e.g., unauthorized access or cyberattacks) through its services.                                                                   | In 2024, the discussion now explicitly incorporates AI services alongside cloud-based services. The risk factors remain similar regarding execution challenges—ensuring reliable, secure, and platform-agnostic service delivery—but with added emphasis on potential unintended or inappropriate uses of powerful AI systems, in addition to fraudulent or abusive activities.                                           | The risk factor is expanded to explicitly include AI alongside cloud services. The 2024 narrative adds a focus on the risks of misuse of AI systems, reflecting the evolving landscape and increased investment in AI capabilities, while still addressing traditional execution concerns such as infrastructure, compatibility, and fraud.                                      |

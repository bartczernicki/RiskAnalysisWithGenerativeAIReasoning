| 1   | Competition in the Technology Sector    | Intense competition across all markets with diverse competitors—from large, resource-rich companies to small, nimble firms—driving rapid technological evolution. Microsoft must continue innovating its products, devices, and services to protect its revenue and operating margins.     | Continues to face intense competition requiring ongoing innovation to meet shifting needs of businesses and consumers, with the risk that failure to do so may adversely affect its overall results of operations.                          | Minor wording updates have been made; the risk remains similar though the language has shifted from “lower revenue or operating margins” to “adversely affect our results of operations.”                     |
| 2   | Competition Among Platform-Based Ecosystems | Focuses on competing platform ecosystems involving vertically integrated models, Windows OS licensing challenges, developer enlistment, and competing content/application marketplaces that can impact cost structures and margins.                                                  | Describes similar challenges, emphasizing risks from competing ecosystems such as vertically integrated models impacting integrated hardware-software offerings, OS licensing pressures, and the need to sustain robust developer ecosystems.       | Largely unchanged in substance with minor clarifications—the language has been refined to stress market dynamics and operating margin impacts, but the overall competitive risks remain similar.                |
| 3   | Business Model Competition               | Highlights pressures from diverse business models including traditional license-based software, a shift toward cloud and infrastructure services, significant investments in AI, and competition from free applications and open source solutions—all of which affect revenue and R&D cost structures. | Reflects similar competitive pressures with updated emphasis on the growing importance of cloud-based and AI services alongside the traditional licensing model, while noting competition from free apps and open source models that challenge revenue.          | Updated language to underscore the enhanced role of cloud and AI services—though the underlying risk of competing business models is consistent, the focus has shifted to better reflect evolving market trends. |
| 4   | Cloud-Based and AI Services Execution Risks  | Addresses execution challenges tied to the increasing focus on cloud-based services, including high infrastructure and development costs, ensuring compatibility and performance across multiple devices, and risks of fraudulent/abusive activities that could harm revenue and reputation.  | Expands the risk description to explicitly include AI services along with cloud-based services, highlighting similar challenges in infrastructure investment, reliability, security, and the potential harm from fraudulent or abusive activities on these platforms. | The scope has been broadened to explicitly cover AI services in addition to cloud-based services, while the underlying operational and execution risks remain similar with updated language reflecting current priorities.  |

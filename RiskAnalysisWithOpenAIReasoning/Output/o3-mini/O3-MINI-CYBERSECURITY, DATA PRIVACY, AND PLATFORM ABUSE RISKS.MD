| 1   | Operations Infrastructure & Scalability  | Microsoft warned that outages, data loss, and disruptions could occur if its operations infrastructure cannot keep pace with increasing user traffic and product complexity. The company emphasized heavy investments in datacenters and related technology and its dependency on permitted land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and components (e.g., GPUs). | The 2024 report similarly highlights risks of outages, data losses, and service disruptions amid growing user traffic and service complexity. It reiterates the need for substantial investments in datacenters and technology while adding water supply as a dependency. The impact is now described in terms of adverse effects on business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. | Mostly consistent across both years with minor modifications. In 2024, there is an added mention of water supply and a stronger emphasis on broader business and operational impacts rather than solely on consolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2   | Supply Chain & Component Availability      | The 2023 filing identified risks from limited suppliers for device and datacenter components. It noted that competitors’ demand, industry shortages, regulatory changes, or other disruptions could delay or limit access to essential hardware components (such as GPUs) and affect datacenter capacity, potentially impacting sales and margins.                         | In 2024, similar concerns are raised regarding quality or supply problems linked to limited suppliers for key components. The disclosure now also highlights efforts to expand datacenter locations and increase server capacity—especially to meet growing AI service demand—with the risk that component shortages or delays could adversely affect overall business, operations, and financial performance.      | The underlying supply chain risk remains, but 2024 expands the discussion by emphasizing capacity expansion for AI services and explicitly linking component issues to broader business outcomes. This reorganization provides clearer context for the impact of supply chain constraints.                                                                                |
| 3   | Software Quality & Reliability             | Microsoft explained that its sophisticated software products might contain bugs or defects that interfere with intended operations. The interdependencies among products could amplify these issues, leading to reduced sales, reputational damage, remediation costs, delays in new releases, and potential legal liability despite contractual limitations on exposure.            | The 2024 disclosure reiterates that software products may experience quality or reliability issues due to bugs or defects. It further notes that interactions with third-party products and services—either those provided by customers or external vendors—could exacerbate quality issues. As before, these defects risk reduced sales, damage to reputation, costly fixes, delays, and legal liabilities.             | While both years stress the risk of software defects, 2024 adds a broader scope by including the potential impact of interactions with third-party products and services, thereby expanding the context and possible severity of these issues.                                                                                                                                           |
| 4   | Hardware Quality & Product Defects         | The 2023 report warned that complex hardware products (such as Xbox consoles and Surface devices) could have design, manufacturing, or software-related defects. Such issues might lead to recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, resulting in significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm.                                             | In 2024, the risk associated with hardware product complexity is again emphasized. The filing stresses that failures to detect or address defects in design, manufacturing, or associated software of products like Xbox and Surface could result in recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims that adversely impact the business and results of operations.                                   | The overall content remains consistent between the two years regarding hardware product risks. In 2024 the discussion is positioned later in the risk factor list, but the essential concerns about quality and product defects have not changed.                                                                                                                                         |

| 1          | Operations Infrastructure and Scalability Risks | Focuses on the risk of outages, data losses, and disruptions if the operations infrastructure fails to scale with increasing user traffic and product complexity. Emphasizes the high capital expenditures in building/upgrading datacenters, dependence on permitted land, energy, networking supplies, and specialized components. | Similar emphasis on maintaining robust online services as user demand grows, with continued investments in datacenter and network infrastructure. The description now includes a mention of insufficient or unavailable water supply as well as power, and rephrases the potential impact on its business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. | Minimal modifications overall; the core risk remains the same, with expanded details (e.g., including water supply) and a rephrasing of potential impacts.                                                                                                                 |
| 2          | Component Supply Chain and Capacity Risks  | Highlights risks stemming from dependency on a limited number of suppliers for critical device and datacenter components, including potential delays, shortages, inventory issues, and supply chain disruptions that may reduce sales and impede the support and development of products and services.                                                                   | Addresses quality or supply problems driven by limited suppliers for device and datacenter components, while also emphasizing efforts to expand datacenter locations and increase server capacity—particularly in light of growing demand for AI services. It notes that such supply issues could adversely affect business, operations, financial condition, and results.                                   | Reordered compared to 2023 and expanded to include strategies around datacenter expansion and support for AI demands, with a broader framing of impact on overall business and financial condition.                                                                     |
| 3          | Software Quality and Reliability Risks     | Describes the risk that defects (such as bugs) in highly sophisticated, interdependent software products and services may interfere with their intended operation. Emphasizes that undetected defects could lead to reduced sales, reputational harm, repair or remediation costs, delays, and potential legal liability.                               | Maintains focus on the risk of software defects and reliability issues, while also noting that interdependencies with third-party products and customer-used applications can magnify these risks. The broader context now includes potential complications arising from interactions with external software and services, possibly increasing reputational and operational impacts. | Largely similar in substance with minor modifications to highlight additional interdependencies with third-party and customer solutions, thereby broadening the scope of potential impacts.                                                                          |
| 4          | Hardware Product Quality and Safety Risks   | Addresses quality or supply problems in hardware products such as Xbox consoles and Surface devices. It focuses on the risk that defects in design, manufacturing, or associated software could trigger recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, leading to significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational damage.              | Now presented as a distinct risk factor, it concentrates solely on the complexity of designing and manufacturing hardware products. It emphasizes that failing to prevent, detect, or address defects can lead to recalls, safety alerts, and product liability claims, adversely affecting the company’s business and operational results.                                                    | Reordered and redefined relative to 2023; hardware quality concerns have been separated from supply chain issues, with increased emphasis on safety, legal liability, and the direct impact of product defects.                                                    |

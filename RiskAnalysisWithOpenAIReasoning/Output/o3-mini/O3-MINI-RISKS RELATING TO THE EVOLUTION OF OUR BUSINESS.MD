| 1 | Operations & Datacenter Dependencies     | Highlights the risk of outages, data losses, and service disruptions due to an increasingly complex operations infrastructure. It emphasizes heavy capital investments in datacenters reliant on available land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and hardware components (e.g., GPUs), with vulnerabilities from clean energy transitions, environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. | Presents a similar risk regarding outages, data losses, and service disruptions caused by infrastructure challenges. It now additionally mentions the risk of insufficient or unavailable power or water supply and more directly links these issues to adverse impacts on business, operations, financial condition, and operating results. | Modified wording with added detail (e.g., water supply) and a clearer articulation of the broader business impact; the core risk remains similar.                                                       |
| 2 | Hardware Supply Chain & Quality/Supply Problems | Combines concerns over quality issues in hardware products (such as Xbox consoles and Surface devices) with supply chain risks. It highlights that defects in design, manufacturing, or associated software—as well as limited suppliers for datacenter components—could lead to recalls, safety alerts, or increased costs due to component shortages and inventory adjustments. | Focuses on quality or supply problems affecting hardware and datacenter components. There is an added emphasis on expanding datacenter locations and server capacity to meet growing, AI-driven demand. It continues to stress that limited suppliers and disruptions in global supply chains (e.g., in Asian assemblies) could adversely affect production and service delivery. | Modified to stress supply chain continuity and capacity expansion for AI services while maintaining concerns over component shortages. The discussion has been streamlined to focus more on supply chain risks. |
| 3 | Software Quality & Reliability Problems      | Addresses the risk that Microsoft’s sophisticated software products may contain bugs or defects that disrupt their intended functions. The interdependence of various products could magnify these issues, potentially resulting in reduced sales, repair or remediation costs, reputational damage, release delays, and legal liabilities—even where contractual provisions limit liability.                    | Similar concerns persist regarding software quality and reliability. However, this version expands the scope by including the impact of interactions with third-party products and services, which may further magnify the consequences of any software defects on business operations and overall performance.                         | Expanded to include third-party interdependencies, thereby broadening the potential impact of software reliability issues.                                                                   |
| 4 | Hardware Product Quality Issues            | Hardware quality concerns were embedded within the broader “quality or supply problems” risk factor. The discussion included potential defects in the design, manufacture, or software of devices (like Xbox and Surface), which could give rise to product recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims.                                                   | Now identified as a distinct risk factor, it explicitly warns that failures to prevent, detect, or address defects in hardware design, manufacturing, or associated software could lead to product recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, thereby adversely impacting business operations and financial results.           | Newly separated as an independent risk factor in 2024, providing a dedicated focus on hardware quality risks distinct from the broader supply chain issues discussed previously.                        |

| 1          | Operational Infrastructure & Service Disruptions | Outages, data losses, and service disruptions are possible if our operations and datacenter infrastructure (including computing power, energy, land, and networking supplies) cannot keep pace with increased user traffic, service growth, and regulatory/geopolitical challenges.                                                                                      | A similar risk is described where outages, data losses, and disruptions may occur if our infrastructure is inadequate. The description now also explicitly mentions dependencies on both power and water supply and shifts emphasis toward potential broader impacts on business, operations, and financial performance.                                                                                                                | **Modified:** Expanded dependency details (adding water supply) and updated impact language—from affecting consolidated financial statements to affecting overall business and operations.                       |
| 2          | Hardware Product Quality & Safety         | Hardware products (such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, etc.) could suffer from defects in design, manufacture, or associated software, which might lead to recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims—resulting in significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if not properly managed.                                                    | Hardware products are noted as highly complex, where any failure to prevent, detect, or address defects in design, manufacture, or associated software could result in recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims that adversely affect our business and results of operations.                                                                                                                                            | **Modified:** The risk factor remains essentially the same but is now repositioned (moved to later in the document) with more concise wording that emphasizes business impact.                                 |
| 3          | Software Product Quality & Reliability      | The sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs or defects that interfere with intended operations. Given the interdependencies among products and the reliance of customers on critical business functions, any defects not caught in pre-release testing could lead to lower sales, remediation costs, delays in product releases, and potential legal liabilities.             | Software products remain at risk of quality or reliability issues. The 2024 description builds on the 2023 narrative by additionally highlighting the potential impact of interactions with third-party products and services, which can further magnify the effects of any defects leading to reduced sales, reputation damage, and legal challenges.                                                                                        | **Modified:** While the core risk remains the same, the updated narrative expands on third-party interdependencies and broadens the scope of the potential operational and reputational impacts.                   |
| 4          | Supply Chain & Component Availability       | There is a dependence on limited suppliers for datacenter and device components. Disruptions—whether due to supplier capacity constraints, shortages, or regulatory changes—could lead to delays in obtaining replacement supplies, potentially reducing sales and affecting our margins due to excess, obsolete inventory, or price adjustments.                           | The concern over limited suppliers for certain components continues. However, the 2024 risk factor now includes a discussion on actively identifying and evaluating opportunities to expand datacenter locations and increase server capacity in response to growing demand for AI services, while acknowledging that supply chain disruptions remain a significant risk to product delivery and development.             | **Modified:** Expanded to include strategic initiatives (like datacenter expansion and increased server capacity) to address evolving demands—particularly in AI—while maintaining supply chain-related risks. |

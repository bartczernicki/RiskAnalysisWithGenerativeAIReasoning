| 1 | Competition in the Technology Sector        | Microsoft faces intense competition from a broad range of players—from diversified global companies with deep R&D resources to small, specialized firms—in markets characterized by low entry barriers and rapid technological change. The company must continuously innovate its products, devices, and services to maintain revenue and operating margins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Microsoft continues to face intense competition from similarly diverse competitors. The language now stresses that failure to consistently innovate and appeal to both businesses and consumers may adversely affect not only revenue and margins but also the company’s overall business, financial condition, and results of operations.                                                                                                                            | Modified wording: While the core risk remains, the description has been broadened in 2024 to emphasize potential adverse effects on overall business and financial condition rather than focusing solely on revenue or operating margins. |
| 2 | Competition among Platform-Based Ecosystems  | Microsoft highlights risks arising from competing ecosystem platforms. Key points include the threat from vertically integrated competitors (who combine software and hardware for consumer products), challenges in a market where Windows licensing on PCs faces competition from new devices and form factors, and the need to enlist high-quality developer participation to overcome competing content and application marketplaces—all of which could reduce margins.                                                 | Similar risks are identified regarding platform-based ecosystems. The 2024 version reiterates the competition from vertically integrated models spanning PCs, tablets, smartphones, gaming consoles, and wearables. It also emphasizes challenges in attracting developers and maintaining OEM relationships, noting that shifts (such as a move to a vertically integrated model) may increase costs and reduce margins.                                         | Modified with updated details: The fundamental risk remains, but the 2024 language has been refined to reflect current device trends (including smartphones) and emphasizes ongoing challenges with OEM relationships and managing cost pressures.                           |
| 3 | Business Model Competition                     | The report outlines competitive pressures from various business models. On one hand, Microsoft’s legacy license-based proprietary software model requires heavy investments in R&D to drive revenue. On the other hand, competitors offer cloud services, free online applications backed by advertising, and open source alternatives that lower their operational expenses. Additionally, significant investments are being made in artificial intelligence (AI), which is expected to be a rapidly evolving competitive arena.            | The 2024 risk factor continues to address competition across multiple business models. It underscores the importance of balancing the traditional license-based revenue model with an ongoing transition to cloud-based services and AI. The discussion now explicitly notes that new competitors are entering the AI space, and the company must remain agile in responding to technological change, regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.  | Modified to explicitly reference the evolving AI market and its competitive challenges. The core risk remains but the 2024 wording places greater emphasis on the balance between legacy models and emerging cloud/AI services, along with new market entrants.                              |
| 4 | Cloud-Based and AI Services Execution Risks    | As Microsoft increases its focus on cloud-based services, it faces significant execution challenges. These include substantial infrastructure investments, the need to offer compelling user experiences across a wide array of devices, ensuring compatibility and performance, and mitigating risks from fraudulent or abusive activities that could harm revenue and operating margins.                                                                                                              | The 2024 report combines cloud-based execution risks with those related to AI services. It emphasizes significant costs to build and maintain infrastructure that supports both cloud and AI offerings. In addition to the original concerns, the updated description also highlights challenges in achieving market adoption, meeting customer reliability and security expectations, and controlling misuse (such as fraud or terms of service breaches), which may adversely affect operations and financial condition. | Modified and expanded: The risk now explicitly includes AI alongside cloud services. The scope has been broadened to cover the dual challenges of building and maintaining robust cloud and AI platforms, with refined language on execution and adoption risks.                     |

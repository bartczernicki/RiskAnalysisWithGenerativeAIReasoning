| 1 | Competition in the Technology Sector        | Intense competition across all markets for Microsoft’s products and services driven by rapidly evolving technologies, shifting consumer needs and frequent product introductions. The language focused on the risk of lower revenue and operating margins if innovation does not keep pace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Persistent intense competition that may adversely affect the results of operations. The risk emphasizes that failure to continue innovating and adapting to changing needs could negatively impact the business, financial condition, and overall operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Largely the same risk, with updated phrasing: the 2024 report shifts from specifically mentioning revenue and margins to a broader impact on results of operations, emphasizing continuous innovation as critical to competitiveness.                                                                      |
| 2 | Competition among Platform-based Ecosystems   | Focused on the challenge of building and sustaining platform-based ecosystems with strong network effects. The risk centers on competition from vertically integrated models (which bundle software, hardware, and services), challenges from alternative operating systems (like those on smartphones/tablets), and the difficulty of attracting developers to compete with established content and application marketplaces.                                                                                                    | Similar emphasis on the need to build and maintain competitive platform ecosystems. The discussion reiterates the threat from vertically integrated competitors across a range of devices (including smartphones and tablets) and highlights the risk that failure to scale these ecosystems could hurt market share and adverse impacts on business results.                                                                                                                         | Essentially similar content, though the 2024 version includes updated references (e.g., explicitly noting smartphones alongside PCs) and reiterates the adverse impact on financial condition if competitive pressures are not met.                                                                       |
| 3 | Business Model Competition                    | Discussed the risks associated with transitioning from a license‐based proprietary software model to cloud‐based services. It covered the heavy investments in R&D and AI, while noting competition from companies offering free, ad‐supported, or open source alternatives that may undercut revenue or mimic features without bearing full R&D costs.                                                                                                                                    | Continues to emphasize risk from evolving business models. While legacy licensing remains significant, the 2024 report puts added focus on the challenges associated with cloud-based and AI services. It notes that new competitors are entering the AI market, and underscores the need to support a dual focus on maintaining traditional revenue streams while transforming the business model.                                                                                | The risk now integrates a stronger focus on AI alongside cloud services. While both reports note the challenges of shifting business models, the 2024 version highlights emerging AI competition and the integration of cloud and AI risks, reflecting evolving market dynamics.                                           |
| 4 | Cloud-based and AI Execution Risks            | Highlighted execution risks as Microsoft increased its focus on cloud-based services. Key concerns included the costs of building and maintaining cloud infrastructure, challenges in generating market share and traffic, ensuring device compatibility, meeting customer reliability and security expectations, and managing evolving delivery models.                                                                                                                              | Expands the scope to explicitly include both cloud-based and AI services. It underscores the importance of delivering compelling cloud-based and AI experiences, addressing challenges in infrastructure costs, performance across an expanding range of devices, and meeting specific customer compliance and security requirements.                                                                                                                  | The 2024 report shifts from solely cloud-based risks to a combined focus on cloud and AI service execution risks. The integration of AI introduces added complexity, thereby broadening the scope of execution challenges compared to 2023.                                                                   |
| 5 | Fraudulent or Abusive Activities in Services  | Identified the risk of fraudulent or abusive activities on cloud-based services, such as unauthorized account use, payment fraud, and misuse (e.g., cryptocurrency mining or cyberattacks), with potential revenue impacts and reputational damage if such activities are not effectively controlled.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Similar concerns about fraudulent or abusive activities persist, but with an expanded focus that now also includes the risk that sophisticated AI systems may be used in unintended or inappropriate ways. The risk encompasses unauthorized access, payment fraud, and misuse of both cloud-based and AI services, with potential adverse impacts on business results and reputation.                                                                        | The 2024 update builds on the existing fraud risk by explicitly including potential misuse of AI systems. This reflects an evolution in the service offerings and an acknowledgment that as AI capabilities are integrated, they too could be exploited in ways that harm the business.                      |

| 1          | Operations Infrastructure and Service Disruptions | Describes risks of excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions if the operations infrastructure (including datacenters, computing power, land, energy, networking supplies, and key server components) is insufficient to meet growing user traffic and product complexity. Failures could lead to reputational damage, contractual liabilities, and adverse financial impacts.                     | Maintains the same overall concerns about outages, data losses, and service disruptions caused by an inadequate infrastructure; however, the 2024 text explicitly adds the risk of an insufficient or unavailable water supply alongside the existing dependencies, and continues to highlight challenges related to scaling services (including increased AI functionality).                                                         | Modified – The fundamental risk remains, but 2024 updates include an explicit mention of water supply risks and rephrased language that underscores evolving infrastructure demands.                                                                                                           |
| 2          | Supply Chain and Component Availability             | Highlights that limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components—due to supplier capacity constraints, industry shortages, regulatory changes, or geopolitical disruptions—can cause delays or shortages, impacting hardware availability (e.g., Xbox, Surface, servers) and potentially reducing sales or datacenter capacity.                                                               | Focuses on quality or supply problems related to limited suppliers for device and datacenter components. The discussion is expanded to include efforts to identify and expand datacenter locations and boost server capacity to meet growing customer needs (particularly with rising demand for AI services). It emphasizes that supply chain disruptions could adversely affect business operations, financial condition, and results. | Modified – While the core concern over limited suppliers and supply chain disruptions remains, 2024 consolidates these issues into one paragraph and adds strategic context (expanding datacenter capacity) in response to evolving AI-related demand.                                                 |
| 3          | Software Quality and Reliability                   | Warns that sophisticated software products might contain bugs or defects that interfere with their intended operation. The interdependence of many products and services means that undetected defects can lead to reduced sales, reputational harm, repair or remediation costs, delays in releases, and legal liabilities.                                                                       | Continues to address quality or reliability problems with software products and services. It now further emphasizes that interactions with third-party products and services—as well as customers’ own systems—can impact reliability. Defects not caught in pre-release testing can cause delays, reputational damage, repair costs, and have adverse impacts on business and financial outcomes.                            | Modified – Largely similar to 2023, but 2024 adds nuance by highlighting third-party interactions and a broader emphasis on the cascading business impacts of software defects.                                                                                                                  |
| 4          | Hardware Product Quality and Safety                | Points out that hardware products—such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices—are highly complex. Defects in design, manufacturing, or associated software could lead to recalls, safety alerts, and product liability claims, with significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as potential consequences.                                                  | Remains focused on the complexity of hardware products (e.g., Xbox, Surface, and related devices). The risk is that failures to prevent, detect, or address defects in design, manufacture, or software could result in recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims that adversely affect the business and operational results.                                                                                            | Modified – The risk remains substantively the same, though its placement at the end of the 2024 document represents a reordering. The language is streamlined while maintaining the focus on defects and their potential operational and legal impacts.                                         |

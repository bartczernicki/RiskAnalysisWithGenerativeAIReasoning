| 1          | Security of our Information Technology              | Describes risks from evolving cyberattacks—including those by hackers, state-sponsored actors, and insider vulnerabilities—that target our IT systems, supply chains, and account security practices.                                                       | Covers similar threats but now incorporates an explicitly disclosed nation-state password spray incident that compromised internal access (including email and source code systems) and notes that adversaries may leverage emerging technologies such as AI and machine learning to develop new attack methods.                                | Modified – Updated to include details of a recent cyber incident and a greater focus on emerging AI-related threats and the challenges in timely detection and remediation. |
| 2          | Security of our Products, Services & Customer Data  | Emphasizes the importance of product security and reliability, highlighting vulnerabilities (e.g., zero-day flaws, legacy systems, open source components), and the risk that customer systems may be compromised if updates or patches are not applied promptly. | Retains similar concerns regarding vulnerabilities and reliance on secure infrastructure but adds context regarding the impact of internal cyber incidents (e.g., the disclosed nation-state attack) and expands on risks from integrating generative AI features as well as continued reliance on open source software vulnerabilities.   | Modified – Language is updated with examples of recent incidents and expanded details on generative AI-related risks and integration challenges.                     |
| 3          | Development and Deployment of Defensive Measures    | Focuses on efforts to engineer and deploy more secure products and services, enhance threat detection, roll out timely updates, and implement mitigation strategies—all while noting that increased costs and potential operational impacts may result if these measures fail.                         | Maintains the same strategic objective of continuously improving security through engineering, enhanced detection, and rapid update deployment, but now emphasizes escalation and timeliness in response measures to counter evolving and sophisticated threats.                                             | Modified – The description is refined to stress the escalation and timeliness of security updates, though the overall defensive strategy remains consistent.        |
| 4          | Disclosure and Misuse of Personal Data              | Highlights the risk that improper disclosure or misuse of personal data by employees or third parties could lead to reputational damage, legal liability, and a loss of customer trust.                                                                       | Continues to emphasize the risks of data misuse and unauthorized disclosure, while now also pointing to potential insider threat activities and the complexities of managing ever-growing volumes of personal data across broader cloud and on-premises offerings.                                                                               | Modified – Expanded to address insider threat concerns and the broader challenges of safeguarding large-scale personal data.                                       |
| 5          | Abuse of Platforms and Digital Safety Abuses        | Addresses the possibility that abuse of our platforms—through activities such as impersonation, dissemination of misleading information, or the exploitation of advertising, marketplace, and gaming services—could harm our reputation and user engagement, particularly due to moderation challenges. | Similar concerns are raised regarding abuse and harmful content on our platforms, with additional emphasis on the role of AI in facilitating impersonation and the spread of misleading information, and the ongoing challenges in content moderation that could expose the company to reputational, regulatory, and financial risks.                     | Modified – The language now explicitly mentions AI’s potential role in facilitating misuse while reaffirming the digital safety challenges inherent in moderating user-generated content. |
| 6          | Product, Ecosystem & IoT Risks                      | Specifically warns that IoT products and services, due to inherent design or update limitations, may be vulnerable—potentially compromising personal safety, product effectiveness, and overall system integrity; this risk is framed within the context of evolving technology and security standards. | Broadens the focus from solely IoT to encompass a wider range of challenges associated with how our products and services integrate into complex customer IT ecosystems, including interactions with third-party hardware/software and high-risk deployment scenarios that may affect security, privacy, and performance.                          | Modified – The risk factor has been expanded from a narrow focus on IoT to a broader view of ecosystem vulnerabilities, addressing the challenges of integrating diverse technologies and deployment contexts.     |
| 7          | Issues in the Development and Use of AI             | Recognizes the risks associated with incorporating AI into our offerings, including algorithmic flaws, biased or inadequate training data, the possibility of generating offensive or harmful content, and potential reputational or legal repercussions.                | Builds upon previous concerns by detailing additional risks such as potential copyright infringement issues, explicit references to emerging regulatory frameworks (e.g., the EU AI Act, U.S. AI Executive Order), and a broader consideration of generative AI’s impact on legal, competitive, and reputational standings.                              | Modified – Expanded with detailed regulatory context and additional concerns over generative AI, emphasizing legal liabilities and competitive impacts alongside the traditional ethical and operational risks.   |

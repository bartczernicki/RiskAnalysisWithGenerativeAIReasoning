| 1   | Competition in the Technology Sector | Faces intense competition from large diversified companies and specialized firms in a fast‐evolving tech market that requires continuous innovation to prevent revenue and margin pressure.                                                          | Also faces intense and diverse competition in rapidly changing technology markets. The language now emphasizes that failure to innovate may adversely affect the overall results of operations.                                                    | Largely similar content; wording shifted from a focus on revenue and operating margins to broader “results of operations” and an explicit note on the need to innovate.                         |
| 2   | Competition Among Platform-Based Ecosystems | Emphasizes the importance of building platform ecosystems with network effects while facing challenges from vertically integrated competitors, PC licensing pressures, and competing content/app marketplaces that can hurt margins.                  | Describes similar risks in establishing and maintaining platform ecosystems, stressing network effects, challenges from vertically integrated models, and OEM conflicts. It concludes with a stronger statement on adverse effects if unsuccessful. | Essentially the same risk factor; the 2024 version uses slightly refined language and a stronger concluding warning about the potential adverse impact on the business and operations.         |
| 3   | Business Model Competition      | Highlights competitive pressure from a variety of business models—from traditional license-based software to free, ad‐supported, and open source offerings—and stresses heavy investments in cloud and AI to stay competitive.                           | Covers similar competition from diverse business models, with added emphasis on the rapid evolution of cloud-based and AI services, evolving pricing/delivery models, and the entry of new competitors into the AI space.                                  | The focus in 2024 is expanded to explicitly include AI and evolving service models; language is refined to note new competitive entrants and changing market dynamics.                          |
| 4   | Cloud and AI Execution Risks    | Details execution risks related to the increasing focus on cloud-based services, including significant infrastructure investments, challenges maintaining device compatibility, potential fraudulent or abusive activities, and service reliability issues. | Describes similar execution and competitive risks but explicitly includes AI services along with cloud-based offerings. It outlines the need to ensure performance across diverse devices, engage developers, and manage misuse or unintended use of AI systems. | 2024 adds explicit mention of AI alongside cloud-related execution risks and expands the discussion on potential misuse, emphasizing the broader scope of operational challenges.              |

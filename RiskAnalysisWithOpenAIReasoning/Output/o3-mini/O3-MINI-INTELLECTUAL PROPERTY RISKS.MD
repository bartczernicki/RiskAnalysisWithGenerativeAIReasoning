| 1       | Infrastructure and Operational Capacity Risks | Describes the risk of outages, data losses, and service disruptions if the operations infrastructure is inadequate. It highlights the need to expand datacenters, upgrade technology, and manage dependencies on land, energy, networking supplies, and critical components – all driven by increasing user traffic, product complexity, and the integration of AI features. | Similarly warns of outages, data loss, and service disruptions due to high demands on datacenters and network infrastructure. The language is updated to explicitly mention risks from insufficient or unavailable power **or water supply** and emphasizes potential adverse effects on the business, financial condition, and operational results. | Minor modifications in wording; the overall risk remains the same but now includes explicit mention of water supply and a broader note on financial impacts.                                                                                        |
| 2       | Supply Chain and Component Shortages         | Points to risks from a limited supply base for datacenter and hardware components. It explains that competitors’ similar supplier relationships and potential supply chain disruptions (due to capacity constraints, regulatory changes, or geopolitical issues) could delay component replacements, affect production, and increase costs.                                                         | Also highlights risks from limited suppliers and supply chain disruptions. In addition, it discusses ongoing efforts to expand datacenter locations and increase server capacity—particularly to meet growing demand for AI services—while noting that delays or shortages in component supply could reduce sales or datacenter capacity.                                         | The content is largely similar but is expanded in 2024 to include proactive capacity expansion efforts driven by increased AI demand.                                                                                                                    |
| 3       | Software Quality and Reliability Risks       | Combines software-related quality risks, noting that sophisticated software products may contain bugs or defects. It stresses that interdependent services and critical business functions might be impacted if issues are not detected pre-release, potentially leading to reduced sales, reputational damage, repair costs, and legal liabilities.                                     | Details software risks in a standalone paragraph. It reiterates that bugs or defects in advanced software can interfere with intended operations. Furthermore, it adds that interactions with third-party products and services might exacerbate these issues, which could result in sales losses, delays, and legal liabilities affecting the business and financial condition. | The risk remains similar, but 2024 separates the software issues from hardware concerns and adds an explicit emphasis on third-party interactions, clarifying the broader interdependencies.                                                           |
| 4       | Hardware Product Quality and Defect Risks      | Mentions that hardware products like Xbox consoles and Surface devices are highly complex and may suffer from design, manufacturing, or software defects. It warns that these issues, if not managed properly, could lead to recalls, safety alerts, and product liability claims—though these were discussed within a combined quality or supply problems risk factor.                            | Presents hardware risks as a distinct factor. It states that defects in the design, manufacture, or associated software of hardware products (e.g., Xbox consoles and Surface devices) could lead to recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, clearly isolating hardware risks from other quality and supply problems.                                                              | In 2024, the hardware-related issues are reorganized into their own distinct risk factor rather than being combined with software-related quality and supply problems, providing clearer delineation between the two areas.                           |

| 1   | Competition in the Technology Sector       | Microsoft faces intense competition from a diverse set of companies—from large, diversified global firms to smaller specialized players—in markets characterized by low entry barriers, rapid technological change, and evolving user needs. Continuous innovation in products, devices, and services is critical to remain competitive.                                               | Microsoft continues to confront intense competition in the technology sector. The report emphasizes the need to keep innovating and delivering appealing products and services to businesses and consumers, with the potential impact extending to adverse effects on overall business, financial condition, and results of operations.                                               | Mostly similar in substance; wording has been modified to stress that failure to innovate could adversely affect overall business and financial outcomes.                                  |
| 2   | Competition among Platform-Based Ecosystems  | The company’s platform-based ecosystem is subject to competitive pressures including: challenges from vertically integrated models (where competitors control both hardware and software), pressures on Windows OS licensing due to alternative platforms for smartphones and tablets, and competition from large-scale content and application marketplaces. These factors can reduce margins and affect market share. | The competitive landscape for platform-based ecosystems remains similar. Microsoft’s risk factor continues to highlight pressures from vertically integrated competitors, challenges in maintaining market share for its licensing platforms, and competition in content and application marketplaces. The narrative now also underscores potential adverse effects on business, operations, and financial condition. | Largely unchanged in content; the language has been slightly refined and now explicitly ties competitive pressures to adverse impacts on business and financial results.                |
| 3   | Business Model Competition                   | Microsoft competes against a variety of business models—from traditional licensing of proprietary software to cloud-based services, significant investments in artificial intelligence, and offerings provided for free (often supported by advertising or open source approaches). This diverse competition requires substantial R&D investment and impacts revenue and margins.                                                | The competitive pressure from various business models continues but with heightened focus on the evolution of cloud-based and AI services. Microsoft stresses ongoing investments in AI and acknowledges that new competitors are entering the AI market, intensifying the competitive dynamics and increasing development and operational costs.                                                                             | Modified to place sharper emphasis on cloud and AI services. The update explicitly mentions new AI market entrants and underscores evolving competitive dynamics impacting cost pressures. |
| 4   | Cloud-Based and AI Services Execution Risks  | As Microsoft expands its cloud-based services, it faces execution risks including high costs to build and maintain the necessary infrastructure, the need to support a growing range of devices and evolving user expectations, and exposure to fraudulent or abusive activities (such as unauthorized account access or misuse of services), which may hurt revenue and reputational standing.                           | The risk factor now combines cloud-based and AI services execution challenges. While similar concerns persist over high infrastructure costs, device compatibility, and ensuring reliable, secure services, the 2024 filing explicitly introduces risks associated with the potential misuse or unintended use of powerful AI systems, in addition to continued concerns about fraud and abuse.                             | Expanded to explicitly include AI services. The update broadens the scope by integrating AI-related execution risks and drawing attention to potential inappropriate use of AI alongside traditional cloud challenges. |

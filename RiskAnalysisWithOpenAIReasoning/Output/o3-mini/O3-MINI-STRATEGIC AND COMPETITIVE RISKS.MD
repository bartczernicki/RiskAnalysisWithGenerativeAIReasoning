| 1   | Competition in the Technology Sector        | Intense competition from a broad range of firms—from large, diversified global companies to smaller specialized firms—in markets with low entry barriers and rapid tech change. The focus is on innovating products, devices, and services to sustain revenue and margins. | Similar emphasis on intense competition across diverse markets, stressing that failure to innovate and meet shifting user needs could adversely affect results of operations. | Largely consistent in substance. The 2024 version shifts the focus slightly by framing the risk in terms of adverse effects on overall operational results rather than solely on revenue or operating margins.    |
| 2   | Competition among Platform-Based Ecosystems | Emphasizes the critical role of platform ecosystems and network effects. Highlights competition from vertically integrated models, challenges in OS licensing (e.g., competition from devices that use alternative operating systems), and marketplace dynamics impacting margins. | Continues to stress the importance of ecosystem scale and network effects, with updated references (e.g., explicit mention of smartphones and tablets). Similar concerns over vertical integration and marketplace constraints remain.           | Minor wording and emphasis updates (e.g., updated device references). The underlying competitive challenges and risks to margins remain substantially the same.                                                  |
| 3   | Business Model Competition & Cloud/AI Execution Risks | Discusses competition based on multiple business models—including the traditional license-based proprietary software and emerging cloud services—with investments in AI. Also raises execution risks such as high R&D and infrastructure costs, service reliability across devices, and potential fraudulent or abusive activities affecting revenue and reputation. | Expands on the business model competition by explicitly integrating cloud-based and AI services (notably generative AI). It underscores evolving pricing and delivery models, additional competition from free/open source offerings, and highlights risks such as unintended AI use alongside traditional fraud concerns. | The 2024 filing broadens the scope by explicitly addressing AI (particularly generative AI) and its associated market dynamics, reflecting an evolution in competitive pressures and execution challenges compared to 2023. |

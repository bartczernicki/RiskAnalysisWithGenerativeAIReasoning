| 1   | Operations and Infrastructure Risk   | Describes risks of outages, data loss, and service disruptions if the operations infrastructure fails—highlighting dependence on datacenter capacity, available land, energy, networking supplies, and key computing components amid growing user traffic and product/service complexity (including the incorporation of AI features).                                                                                                         | Presents a nearly identical risk: potential outages, data loss, and disruptions from shortcomings in the operations infrastructure. The language now also mentions insufficient water supply (in addition to power) and emphasizes the evolving regulatory and competitive constraints that could affect the business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.                                     | Largely unchanged. The update includes minor language modifications such as the addition of water supply as a dependency and a clearer linkage to broader business and financial impacts.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2   | Hardware Supply Chain and Capacity Issues | Combines quality and supply problems for hardware by noting that complex devices (e.g., Xbox consoles, Surface devices) may suffer from design, manufacturing, or component issues. It also acknowledges that limited suppliers for key datacenter and hardware components may lead to shortages, delays, or increased costs, thereby potentially reducing sales and affecting operational capabilities.                         | Focuses explicitly on supply chain challenges. It notes the limited supply of device and datacenter components and emphasizes efforts to expand datacenter locations and increase server capacity—especially to meet the growing demand for AI-related services. It highlights that component shortages or disruptions in global supply can reduce sales and adversely impact operations and financial results. | While the core concern over supply chain disruptions remains, the 2024 update refines the focus by emphasizing datacenter capacity expansion and the growing AI demand. Additionally, issues related to component and supplier limitations are presented separately from the hardware product defect risks.                                                            |
| 3   | Software Quality or Reliability Risk   | Warns that highly sophisticated and interdependent software products may contain bugs or defects. Such quality issues can result in operational disruptions, lower sales, reputational damage, remediation costs, delayed releases, and potential legal liability—even though license agreements may limit exposure.                                                                                        | Continues to address the risk of software defects and reliability issues. In addition to similar concerns about bugs and defects, the 2024 version adds nuance by noting that interactions with third-party products and services—and the reliance of customers on these integrations—can further magnify the impact of any deficiencies on critical business functions.                        | Basically consistent with the earlier risk but with added emphasis on dependencies and interactions with third-party products and services. This update reflects the growing complexity and interconnectedness of software ecosystems.                                                                                                                                |
| 4   | Hardware Product Defects Risk          | Implicitly included within the broader discussion of hardware quality or supply problems, noting that defects in design, manufacture, or associated software in products like Xbox and Surface devices could lead to recalls, safety alerts, and product liability claims that would harm the company’s reputation and financial performance.                                                       | Now articulated as a separate risk factor, this section specifically highlights that the inherent complexity of hardware products (such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, etc.) exposes them to risks from defects in design, manufacturing, or software. Such defects could result in recalls, safety alerts, or liability claims with adverse effects on business outcomes. | Unlike in 2023—where product defects were bundled with supply issues—the 2024 filing separates hardware design and defect risks as a distinct item, signifying a heightened emphasis on the potential liabilities arising solely from manufacturing and design issues.                                                                     |

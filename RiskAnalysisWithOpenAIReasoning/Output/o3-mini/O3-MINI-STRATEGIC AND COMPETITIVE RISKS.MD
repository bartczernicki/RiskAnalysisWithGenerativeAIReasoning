| 1          | Operational Infrastructure Challenges | Risk of outages, data losses, and service disruptions arising from an inadequate operations infrastructure. The 2023 filing underscores the challenges of scaling datacenters and network resources to support growing user traffic and a more complex portfolio (including enhanced AI features), while depending on critical resources like permitted land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and specialized hardware components (e.g. GPUs). | Risk remains centered on potential outages, data losses, and service disruptions from inadequate operational infrastructure. The 2024 filing adds concern over insufficient or unavailable water supply (in addition to power and connectivity issues) and shifts the impact language to broadly affect business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. | Modified: Expanded scope to include water supply issues and broadened the described impact from solely financial statements to overall business and operational performance. |
| 2          | Supply Chain and Capacity Constraints   | Addresses challenges due to limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. In 2023, competition for critical parts and supplier capacity constraints could lead to delays, shortages, reduced sales, and inadequate datacenter capacity to support current and future services.                                                                                                                         | Focuses on similar supplier constraints and component availability issues. However, the 2024 filing emphasizes proactive measures—identifying opportunities to expand datacenter locations and increase server capacity—to meet evolving needs, notably driven by the growing demand for AI services. Disruptions remain a risk, potentially affecting sales and operational stability.                                                              | Modified: Enhanced focus on proactive capacity expansion for AI services and strategic datacenter growth while maintaining concerns over limited supplier availability.          |
| 3          | Software Quality and Reliability Issues   | Highlights that bugs and defects in the highly sophisticated, interdependent software products can impair functionality, leading to reduced sales, remediation costs, reputational harm, release delays, and potential legal liabilities.                                                                                                                                                    | Continues to address risks from software defects but now includes explicit consideration of interdependencies among its own products and with third-party offerings. This expanded perspective underlines that interactions with external products and services may further magnify the impact of any software quality issues on business performance and financial results.                                                    | Modified: Added emphasis on the interdependencies with third-party products and services, intensifying the potential overall impact of software-related issues.                  |
| 4          | Hardware Product Quality Risks         | Warns that complex hardware products (e.g., Xbox, Surface) may suffer from design, manufacturing, or associated software defects. Such quality or supply problems could result in significant expenses, lost revenue, and damage to reputation if issues (like product defects) are not detected and addressed timely.                                                                                            | Presents hardware product risks as a standalone category. The 2024 filing details that failures in design, manufacture, or associated software of hardware products could lead to recalls, safety alerts, and product liability claims, directly affecting business performance and operations.                                                                                                                                    | Modified: Restructured as an independent risk factor with a more explicit focus on potential recalls, safety alerts, and product liability claims resulting from hardware defects.  |

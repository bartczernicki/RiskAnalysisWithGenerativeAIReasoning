| 1          | Operations Infrastructure & Datacenter Capacity Risk | Emphasizes the need to maintain a robust operations infrastructure and datacenters to handle increasing user traffic and the growing complexity of products and services. Highlights dependencies on buildable land, predictable energy, reliable networking supplies, servers (including GPUs), and the risks from environmental regulations, geopolitical disruptions, and the transition to a clean energy economy. Operational failures (e.g., outages, data loss, insufficient power) could affect products, services, and the consolidated financial statements. | Similarly stresses the importance of maintaining and expanding a robust infrastructure to support growth. The description remains largely the same with dependencies on permitted land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and critical hardware components. Notably, it now includes risks from an insufficient or unavailable water supply and emphasizes that failures (like outages or data losses) could adversely affect the business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. | Largely consistent in focus, with minor modifications in wording. The 2024 version expands on the types of supply risks (adding water supply) and shifts the impact language from “consolidated financial statements” to a broader “business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations,” reflecting an evolution in impact assessment. |
| 2          | Hardware Product Quality Issues            | Addresses quality and supply problems for hardware products (e.g., Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other designed devices) that are highly complex. Defects in design, manufacture, or software could lead to recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, potentially causing significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if not detected or remedied.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Discusses the inherent complexity of hardware products, noting that failure to prevent, detect, or address defects in design, manufacture, or associated software may lead to recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims. The language is more direct in linking these issues to adverse effects on business operations and financial results.                                                                                                                  | While the fundamental risk remains similar, the 2024 filing reorders this risk factor (now as a distinct point later in the list) and uses more explicit phrasing regarding potential adverse impacts on business and results.                                                                                                               |
| 3          | Limited Suppliers & Supply Chain Risks      | Highlights that limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components can expose Microsoft to risks. Competitors using the same suppliers may create capacity constraints, shortages, or delays—whether due to supplier capacity, industry shortages, or regulatory changes—thereby affecting sales, increasing costs through inventory adjustments, and potentially impacting operating margins.                                                                                                                                                                   | Integrates the supplier limitations with a proactive focus on expanding datacenter locations and increasing server capacity to meet evolving customer demands (notably driven by AI services). It reiterates that supplier constraints—driven by capacity limitations, shortages, or regulatory changes—can delay component availability and adversely affect service delivery and business performance.                                                      | In 2024, the risk factor has been modified to combine the limited supplier risk with strategic initiatives that address capacity expansion. The new language links supply chain challenges with a proactive response to rising AI demand and evolving customer needs.                                                                                   |
| 4          | Software Product Quality and Reliability Risks | Focuses on the potential for defects or bugs in sophisticated software products and services that could interfere with intended operations. Such defects, if undetected pre-release, might lead to reduced sales, reputation damage, repair or remediation costs, delays in product releases, and legal liabilities—even though license agreements attempt to limit exposure.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Continues to emphasize the risk of software defects while adding focus on the interconnected nature of Microsoft’s products and services. The 2024 filing underscores that software issues may be magnified by interactions among dependent systems and by reliance on third-party products and services, thereby increasing the potential impact on business operations and overall financial performance.                                      | The 2024 version evolves by incorporating the complexity added by interdependencies and third-party integrations. This additional layer means that the potential adverse impacts of software defects are now viewed as having a broader, more interconnected effect on business performance.                                                               |

| 1   | Competition in the Technology Sector   | Microsoft faces intense competition from a broad range of firms—from diversified global companies to specialized players—in markets that change rapidly due to disruptive technologies and shifting customer needs. Innovation in products and services is critical to sustaining revenue and operating margins.                                                   | The company continues to face intense competition in rapidly evolving technology markets. The report emphasizes that if innovation and the ability to deliver appealing products and services are not maintained, it may adversely affect business operations, financial condition, and overall results.                                         | Modified: The overall risk remains the same, but the language shifts from stating reliance on innovation to warning that failure to innovate could directly impact financial performance and operations.                         |
| 2   | Competition among Platform-Based Ecosystems | Risks arise from competing ecosystem platforms, including challenges from vertically integrated models, significant licensing revenue concentration on Windows, and competition in content and application marketplaces. These factors can drive up operating costs and put pressure on margins through OEM conflicts and the rapid evolution of devices and user preferences.           | Similar competitive risks exist from platform-based ecosystems. The discussion continues to focus on challenges posed by vertically integrated competitors, competition from new device form factors (such as smartphones and tablets), and content/application marketplace dynamics that may affect market share and margins.                                   | Modified: Minor wording updates refine the emphasis on market share and margin pressures, while the substance remains consistent between the two years.                                                                        |
| 3   | Business Model Competition             | The company competes against a variety of business models—including legacy license-based software, cloud-based services, free applications funded by advertising, and open source products. Significant investments in R&D and AI are undertaken to maintain competitiveness, even though these efforts are countered by competitors that may not incur the same costs.                     | The risk factor continues to address competition across various business models. There is an added emphasis on the rapidly evolving AI market and the fact that new competitors are entering this space. Traditional challenges from legacy licensing coexist with pressures from cloud-based and AI-driven offerings, as well as free and open source models. | Modified: Language now explicitly highlights emerging competition in the AI sector, noting new market entrants, while essentially retaining the broader risk associated with multiple business models.                        |
| 4   | Execution Risks for Cloud-Based and AI Services | As Microsoft increases its focus on cloud-based services, it faces execution risks related to infrastructure investments, maintaining compatibility and performance across devices, and mitigating fraudulent or abusive activities that could harm revenue and reputation.                                                                                            | The risk factor has been expanded to cover both cloud-based and AI services. It emphasizes the challenges in delivering compelling cloud and AI experiences, including high infrastructure costs, ensuring security and reliability across a diverse set of devices, and addressing potential unintended or inappropriate use of AI systems along with fraud risks.      | Modified: The scope has been broadened to explicitly incorporate AI service risks alongside cloud challenges, with added detail on execution issues and potential misuse of AI systems.                                        |

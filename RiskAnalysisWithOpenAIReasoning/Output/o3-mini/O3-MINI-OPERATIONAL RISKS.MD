| 1   | Competition in the Technology Sector       | Microsoft faces intense competition from a broad range of competitors—from diversified global firms to small, specialized companies—with low barriers to entry and rapidly changing technologies. Failure to continually innovate and meet shifting customer needs could lead to reduced revenue and operating margins.                                                                                                                                | Microsoft similarly acknowledges intense competition from both large diversified firms and specialized competitors. The language now emphasizes that failing to innovate and provide appealing products and services may adversely affect its business, financial condition, and overall results of operations.                                                                                                                     | The overall message is unchanged. The 2024 language slightly broadens the negative impact to include the company’s financial condition and overall operations, while reinforcing the need for continuous innovation.                                                                                                                                    |
| 2   | Competition Among Platform-Based Ecosystems  | Microsoft’s business model relies on building platform-based ecosystems that generate network effects among users, developers, and the company. Risk factors include competition from vertically integrated models (where competitors control both hardware and software), challenges with Windows OS licensing in the face of low-cost alternatives, and competing content and application marketplaces—all of which can pressure margins. | The 2024 filing maintains a similar discussion on platform-based ecosystems, highlighting risks from vertically integrated companies (now mentioning PCs, tablets, and smartphones more explicitly), competition in PC OS licensing against low or no-cost alternatives, and challenges competing in content/app marketplaces. The summary concludes that failure to compete successfully may adversely affect Microsoft’s business, operations, and financial condition. | The risk factor remains largely the same with only minor rewording. The 2024 version reiterates the importance of scale and network effects and more explicitly ties failure to compete with adverse impacts on overall business and financial results.                                                       |
| 3   | Business Model Competition                  | Microsoft notes that while it continues to generate revenue from its traditional proprietary license-based software, it is also investing heavily in cloud-based services and AI capabilities. Competitors in various business models—including those offering free applications, online services supported by advertising, and open source alternatives—could pressure margins as they do not always incur the same R&D costs. | In 2024, the discussion of business model competition is similar, with an emphasis on the critical role of cloud-based services and AI. The filing details that significant resources are being devoted to both cloud and AI strategies, while traditional license-based software remains important. Competitors using free/app/ad-based or open source models continue to pose a challenge.                                                     | The 2024 version reorders the discussion, placing greater emphasis on the material importance of cloud-based and AI services. It also mentions that new competitors are entering the AI space, reinforcing the risk from multiple business models, though the underlying competitive threats remain similar.                                    |
| 4   | Cloud‑Based and AI Service Execution Risks  | Microsoft’s shifting focus toward cloud-based services involves significant investments in infrastructure and development. The company highlights challenges in delivering compelling cloud experiences across a variety of devices, meeting customer reliability and compliance needs, and controlling fraudulent or abusive activities on these services.                                                                                                     | In 2024, this risk factor expands to explicitly include AI services alongside cloud computing. The filing outlines that significant costs are incurred in building and maintaining cloud and AI infrastructure. It lists similar execution challenges—such as delivering compelling, device‑agnostic experiences, meeting reliability/security expectations, and mitigating fraud—but now also warns of risks related to unintended or inappropriate uses of its AI systems. | The 2024 disclosure expressly integrates AI into this risk factor, reflecting its growing strategic importance. While the cloud-related risks persist, the addition highlights potential operational challenges and misuse unique to AI systems, broadening the scope of execution risks.               |

This table captures the main areas where the risk factors are similarly addressed in both filings while pinpointing the modifications and expanded emphasis—particularly on AI—that appear in the 2024 report.

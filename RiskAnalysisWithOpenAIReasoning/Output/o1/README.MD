# Collection of Risk Analysis Output Files from o1

Each file (other than the Consolidated Risk Analysis) represents a risk factor section from the SEC 10-K Document comparing two years.  
Each file is a Markdown Table for easy human comprehension that includes the: Title, 2023 Risk Factor, 2024 Risk Factor and the Differences between the two years.  

The Consolidated Risk Analysis Files combines the sufficiently important risks into one (consolidated) risk file:

| 1   | Significant Investments in Products, Services, and AI | Microsoft invests heavily in R&D for existing and new offerings (e.g., Windows, Microsoft 365, Azure, gaming, AI). Success depends on innovation, distribution, and market acceptance. Data handling practices face scrutiny, and poor perception or low feature engagement (e.g., Edge, Bing) can impact revenue and margins.   | Similar emphasis on large R&D investments (including AI and hardware) with uncertain returns. Notes that new products may not be profitable or achieve historical margins. Reiterates data handling scrutiny and potential negative perception. Merges complexities of technology development and possible delays into the same factor. | Mostly the same risk factor but expanded to consolidate the “developing new technologies” discussion. References to particular features (e.g., Bing Chat) are less explicit, and the text more generally addresses potential low engagement.                                                |
| 2   | Complexities in Developing New Technologies          | A standalone factor highlighting that new technologies require extensive development and testing. Delays or technical difficulties could negatively impact revenue and product launches.                                                                                                                                       | This topic is folded into the broader discussion of significant investments. Emphasizes that development challenges (long lead times, potential delays) could adversely affect business, financial condition, and operating results.                                                                                      | No longer a separate heading in 2024; merged into the first risk factor discussing significant investments and the inherent complexity and risks in product development.                                                                               |
| 3   | Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, and Strategic Alliances | Details the risks of acquisitions (e.g., ZeniMax, Nuance) and the pending Activision Blizzard deal, including integration challenges, potential compliance issues, and uncertain returns. Success depends on effectively combining technologies and teams, and acquisitions may take time to deliver anticipated benefits.     | Reflects completed acquisitions (e.g., Activision Blizzard in October 2023), but highlights ongoing Federal Trade Commission challenges that could potentially unwind the deal. Stresses limited control over third-party partners and reiterates the risk of protracted realization of benefits or failing to meet expectations. | Expanded to acknowledge the finalization of the Activision Blizzard acquisition, the potential for regulatory pushback even after closing, and the risk of partial or complete unwinding. Additional mention of limited control over partners.                                                 |
| 4   | Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment             | Warns that if acquired assets or goodwill are impaired based on market shifts or reduced cash flow, Microsoft may record significant charges affecting financial results. Annual impairment tests help identify risks, but a write-down can negatively impact earnings in the period recognized.                               | Repeats the same concerns about goodwill and intangible asset impairment. Notes that external factors (e.g., stock price decline, lower growth rates) may trigger impairment and result in substantial charges.                                                                                                             | Largely unchanged. Continues to emphasize periodic impairment testing and the potential for negative effects on financials if intangible assets are determined to be overvalued.                                                                                  |

| 1 | Cyberattacks & Security Vulnerabilities                    | Highlights the evolving nature of cyberattacks and their potential to reduce revenue, increase costs, incur liability, and harm reputation or competitive position. Emphasizes state-sponsored attacks, potential breaches, and the increasing sophistication of cyber threats.           | Restates the general cyber threat environment but adds a specific instance of a nation-state attacker gaining unauthorized access to Microsoft’s IT systems and source code. Acknowledges the difficulty of detecting attacks and the ongoing risk of cascading impacts from such breaches.      | Expanded with a real example of a late 2023 nation-state attack, emphasizing the potentially long-lasting, complex nature of cyber incidents and including more detailed language around the investigation and remediation.                                                                      |
| 2 | Security of Our Information Technology                     | Discusses the variety of malicious methods (social engineering, supply chain compromises, etc.) and the challenges in detecting sophisticated attacks. Also addresses employees or third parties who might compromise systems, and the difficulty of keeping pace with emerging threats. | Similar content but references the actual breach disclosed via an 8-K filing, highlighting an attack via a compromised legacy test account. Stresses that such attacks may persist and intensify during conflicts and that internal or acquired third-party practices may be inadequate.         | Significantly expanded to include real-world examples of unauthorized access, new insights on supply chain vulnerabilities, and nation-state threats. Emphasizes the persistent and evolving nature of these attacks and their potential extended impacts.                                      |
| 3 | Security of Our Products, Services, & Customer Data        | Underscores customer reliance on Microsoft’s cloud and on-premises security, the risk of zero-day vulnerabilities (e.g., Exchange Server), open source component weaknesses, and emerging generative AI risks. Notes the challenge of supporting older systems and the importance of patches. | Reiterates the same core issues but includes explicit mention of how attacks on Microsoft’s own IT infrastructure can affect customers. Emphasizes generative AI features’ unanticipated threats, zero-day exploits, hardware dependencies, and the difficulty of ensuring customers install patches. | Maintains the same fundamental concerns but references more concrete examples and expanded generative AI risks. Emphasizes the ramifications of intrusions to Microsoft’s own systems impacting customer trust and merges in broader concerns about open source and AI vulnerabilities.              |
| 4 | Development & Deployment of Defensive Measures             | Focuses on the continuous need to engineer secure products, enhance threat detection, deploy timely patches, and inform customers about security best practices. Warns that failing to address threats may harm reputation and customer confidence.                                        | Similar focus on timely patching and robust security tooling, with additional emphasis on potential outages or data losses caused by remediation efforts. Addresses specialized needs of certain industries and includes a broader commitment to better vulnerability disclosures.               | Reflects a slightly stronger emphasis on timeliness and the challenges in mitigating sophisticated breaches. New references to the potential for remediation efforts themselves to cause service disruptions, thus broadening the scope of potential harm.                                        |
| 5 | Disclosure & Misuse of Personal Data                       | Notes the large amounts of personal data processed in cloud-based offerings and the hostile cybersecurity environment. Warns of improper disclosure or insider threats leading to reputational harm, legal exposure, and constraints on data center operations.                            | Maintains similar points on data volume and breach risks but explicitly highlights insider threat activities and the possibility of failing to detect or mitigate them. Reinforces that privacy expectations can limit sales and hamper cloud adoption if data is perceived as inadequately protected. | Expands on the insider threat aspect and clarifies the potential for ongoing improvement of security controls. Otherwise, the overall risk remains similar, with increased specificity on how data misuse can escalate legal and reputational issues.                                              |
| 6 | Protecting Information in Our Products/Services            | Addresses concerns over third parties scraping or harvesting data (e.g., LinkedIn), changes in law or interpretations that may reduce Microsoft’s ability to protect information, and reputational/competitive harm if data is misused.                                                  | Substantially the same concept: Microsoft’s platforms contain valuable data and may be scraped or otherwise misused. Mentions the possibility that legal developments could further limit Microsoft’s protective measures.                                                                            | Continues the previous year’s caution around unauthorized data scraping or misuse. Language is updated to emphasize potential adverse business impacts if legal frameworks or interpretations weaken data protection mechanisms.                                                                |
| 7 | Abuse of Our Platforms                                     | Focuses on abuses in advertising, professional platforms, marketplaces, and gaming. Hostile or inappropriate content, user impersonations, or manipulative AI can harm reputation and user engagement, requiring substantial investments to mitigate.                                      | Restates the same range of abusive content across platform products but with a clearer acknowledgment of AI-powered impersonation and heightened regulatory expectations around harmful content.                                                                                                 | Expanded references to AI-driven malicious content and the possibility of stricter regulatory oversight or liability for failing to moderate harmful or illegal content. Broad theme remains consistent, but language about technological complexity and scale is strengthened.                    |
| 8 | IoT & Other Digital Safety Risks                           | Explores how IoT solutions (with many layers of hardware/software) can introduce security/privacy risks. Notes the difficulty of patching IoT devices, the need for compliance with regulations, and potential health/safety implications.                                               | Merges IoT with broader security complications. Highlights that customers’ complex IT ecosystems and third-party actions can undermine security. Reiterates health/safety implications and the possibility of legal claims if systems fail or are misused.                                       | The IoT-specific risk merges into a broader discussion of product/service usage, with an emphasis on third-party and customer misuse. Broader framing addresses multi-layered solutions (including AI) and their real-world impacts, including new or evolving privacy and safety concerns.         |
| 9 | Issues in the Development & Use of AI                      | Warns that AI poses ethical, privacy, and reputational risks if data sets or algorithms are flawed or biased, and that AI-generated content may be offensive or harmful. Mentions potential legal liability, regulatory action, and brand harm if AI is misused or fails.                     | Similar concerns about flawed algorithms, biased training data, offensive or infringing AI outputs, and unintended consequences. Adds references to emerging AI legislation (e.g., EU AI Act, U.S. Executive Order) and ongoing litigation risks (copyright, data protection).                          | Reflects a more comprehensive global regulatory and legal landscape for AI, highlighting new proposed laws and expanding on potential legal, ethical, and brand consequences. Emphasizes Microsoft’s responsible AI framework and possible liability under evolving AI regulations.                |

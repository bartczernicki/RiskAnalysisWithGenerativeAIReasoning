| Security of Our Information Technology (Actual Intrusions)      | • Potential for operational disruption, reputational harm, and legal exposure due to newly confirmed nation-state intrusion.                              | • 2024 highlights a verified breach in late 2023, shifting this threat from hypothetical to actual.  
• Demonstrates the sophistication and persistence of attackers, potentially requiring higher security spending and more robust controls.                                                              | • Significantly altered: moves from theoretical risk to real incident, elevating its priority and urgency.              |
| Security of Products, Services, Devices, and Customer Data       | • Greater adversarial focus on both Microsoft and customer environments; possible data breach liabilities, customer trust erosion, and service downtime. | • 2024 underscores advanced AI-enabled attacks and specifies actual intrusions.  
• Draws attention to unpatched systems, open-source dependencies, and the possibility of cascading risks across cloud/on-premises setups.                                                             | • Substantially revised: from general warnings to actionable, real-world examples and heightened vulnerabilities.       |
| Disclosure and Misuse of Personal Data (Insider Threats)         | • Amplified liability, regulatory fines, and reputational damage if insider misuse or third-party misappropriation leads to personal data breaches.      | • 2024 explicitly names insider threats as a pronounced risk, noting difficulty detecting or preventing malicious insiders or vendors.  
• Emphasizes stricter privacy regulations and the resulting financial/operational consequences of non-compliance.                                                | • Meaningfully expanded: introduces insider threats as a key component, intensifying regulatory and brand risk.         |
| Abuse of Our Platforms (AI-Generated Content & Moderation)       | • Heightened litigation, fines, or reputational fallout if harmful, AI-generated, or illegal content goes unchecked.                                     | • 2024 calls out AI-driven impersonation, misinformation, and disinformation as a rapidly growing concern.  
• Spotlights evolving moderation laws that could hold Microsoft directly liable for failing to address abusive content.                                          | • Materially updated: emphasis shifts from general abusive behavior to urgent AI-related content moderation challenges. |
| Broader Product Usage Risks (Formerly IoT-Specific)              | • Potential for serious liability and reputational harm if products (including AI/IoT) are deployed in safety-critical or high-stakes scenarios.         | • 2024 merges IoT concerns into a wider product and service usage category, acknowledging that unexpected or untested uses (e.g., healthcare/industrial) can magnify security and safety risks.                                            | • Newly reframed: expands beyond IoT and underscores how diverse or critical deployments can escalate harm.            |
| Issues in the Development and Use of AI (Expanded Regulation)    | • Legal, financial, and brand repercussions from biased, infringing, or unsafe AI outputs; risk of non-compliance with new AI laws.                      | • 2024 discusses regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, U.S. AI Executive Order) and highlights broader consequences of AI misuse (copyright infringement, ethical violations, litigation exposure).  
• Positions AI risk as key to Microsoft’s strategy and competitive posture. | • Significantly enhanced: evolves from theoretical AI concerns to real regulatory and litigation exposures, elevating AI from a niche risk to a major strategic factor. |

| Security of Our Information Technology (Actual Intrusions)      | • Potential for operational disruption, reputational harm, and legal exposure due to state-sponsored cyberattacks   | • 2024 reveals a verified nation-state breach in late 2023, demonstrating sophisticated, persistent threats.  
• Highlights how new attacker techniques (e.g., AI-enabled attacks) can prolong access, deepen exposure, and increase remediation challenges. | • Significant update from purely hypothetical scenarios to a real incident. 
• Underscores the immediate and ongoing need for increased defensive spending and vigilance.                   |
| Security of Products, Services, Devices, and Customer Data       | • Widespread impact on customers if Microsoft infrastructure is compromised  
• Risk of cascading attacks targeting cloud/on-premises environments | • 2024 reports specific intrusions and new threats from generative AI or zero‐day exploits.  
• Emphasizes that unpatched systems and open-source components heighten potential vulnerabilities, affecting both Microsoft and clients.            | • Expands from general concerns to detailing actual incidents and complex new attack vectors.  
• Elevates urgency for robust patching and faster incident response.                   |
| Disclosure and Misuse of Personal Data (Insider Threats)         | • Heightened liability, potential fines, and damage to brand trust if personal data is mishandled or stolen         | • 2024 spotlights insider threats explicitly, revealing the difficulty of fully preventing or detecting employee/vendor misuse.  
• Emphasizes that growing privacy regulations amplify the cost of data breaches.                                   | • Adds critical detail on insider-enabled breaches, broadening the scope beyond external hacking.  
• Intensifies regulatory scrutiny and potential reputational fallout if data misuse persists.                    |
| Abuse of Our Platforms (AI-Generated Content & Moderation)       | • Risk of regulatory penalties, lawsuits, and damage to user trust if harmful or illegal content proliferates       | • 2024 highlights AI-driven impersonation, disinformation, and deeperfakes as rapidly escalating concerns.  
• Notes that evolving moderation laws could hold Microsoft directly liable for failing to remove harmful content promptly.                              | • Moves from general content concerns to urgent focus on AI usage in abuse scenarios.  
• Demonstrates rising regulatory risk and potential brand harm from inadequate moderation.                         |
| Broader Product Usage Risks (Formerly IoT-Specific)              | • Liability and reputational damage if products/services (including IoT and AI) are misused in safety-critical or high-risk setups | • 2024 merges IoT concerns into a wider product usage category, stressing that diverse or unexpected deployments (e.g., healthcare, industrial environments) magnify potential harm.  
• Highlights that customers may fail to patch or misconfigure solutions.       | • Shifts from narrower IoT vulnerabilities to a comprehensive view of product misuse.  
• Reflects higher stakes as more Microsoft products power essential infrastructure and real-world operations.     |
| Issues in the Development and Use of AI (Expanded Regulation)    | • Possible legal, financial, and brand damage from biased AI, copyright disputes, or harmful outcomes              | • 2024 discusses new and proposed AI laws (e.g., EU AI Act, U.S. AI Executive Order), increasing compliance and liability pressures.  
• Underscores broader ethical and competitive risks if customers or regulators reject unsafe or untrustworthy AI.  | • Moves beyond theoretical AI concerns to concrete regulatory enforcement and litigation exposure.  
• Elevates AI risk from a niche worry to a major factor impacting product strategy and competitive position.        |

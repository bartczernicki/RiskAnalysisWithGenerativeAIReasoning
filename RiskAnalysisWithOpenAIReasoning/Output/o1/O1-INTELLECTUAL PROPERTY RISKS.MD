| 1 | Significant Investments in Products and Services        | Emphasizes large investments in R&D, marketing, and acquisitions (e.g., Windows, Office 365, Azure, Xbox, LinkedIn). Highlights uncertainty of commercial success, importance of innovation, potential low engagement in features (Edge, Bing), and scrutiny over data practices. Delays or failure to meet revenue expectations could adversely affect results.                                                                                                                 | Stresses continuing substantial investment in existing and AI-driven products. Maintains focus on innovation, distribution, and marketing, with an acknowledgment that new offerings may not generate immediate or high-margin returns. Warns of insufficient engagement and ongoing data-management scrutiny. Combined “developing new technologies is complex” within this risk, noting potential delays and business impacts. | Modified. Content is expanded to emphasize AI and merges the “developing new technologies is complex” element under the same heading. The core risk remains, with added detail on timing and profitability challenges.                                                                  |
| 2 | Developing New Technologies is Complex                  | Identified separately, highlighting long development and testing periods. States significant delays or issues could undermine product releases and hurt revenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Folded into the “Significant Investments” risk factor. Emphasizes the same challenges (long development times, potential release delays) and ties them directly to broader investment risks and overall business impact.                                                                                                                   | Merged. No longer a standalone heading in 2024; its content is incorporated into the first risk factor.                                                                                                                                       |
| 3 | Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, and Strategic Alliances   | Discusses continued M&A strategy (ZeniMax, Nuance, planned Activision Blizzard, OpenAI investment), including integration challenges, unsatisfactory returns, compliance obligations, and potential distraction to management. Notes benefits may take longer than expected or be smaller than anticipated, which could adversely affect financials.                                                        | Updates the status of acquisitions (e.g., completion of Activision Blizzard in October 2023) and partnership with OpenAI. Mentions risks associated with post-closing regulatory challenges (FTC challenge). Reiterates the same difficulties in integration, compliance, and extracting full benefits.                                                                                 | Modified. Reflects completed and ongoing acquisitions, plus continued regulatory scrutiny (FTC). Retains the same fundamental risks with new details about recent transactions.                                                                                                       |
| 4 | Impairment of Goodwill or Intangible Assets            | Highlights the potential need to write down goodwill or intangible assets if acquired businesses or assets fail to meet expectations. Notes triggers such as declining market price, reduced future cash flow, or slower industry growth. An impairment charge could negatively affect results.                                                                                                                        | Reiterates the possibility of impairment and the same triggers (stock price declines, lower cash flows). Warns that significant charges could arise should goodwill or intangible assets become unrecoverable, affecting reported earnings.                                                                                                                                           | Largely unchanged. The same factors and potential impacts remain, with no substantive alterations in scope or emphasis.                                                                                                                        |

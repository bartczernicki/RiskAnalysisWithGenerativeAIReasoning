| # | Title | 2023 Risk Factor Summary | 2024 Risk Factor Summary | Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Cyberattacks and Security Vulnerabilities** | Highlights the risk of cyberattacks threatening revenue, costs, liability, and reputation due to evolving tactics by hackers, including nation-state actors. Emphasizes potential harm from ransomware, supply chain attacks, and disruption to services. | Reiterates similar threats but notes Microsoft’s own recent experience of unauthorized access to internal and customer systems, including a nation-state attack. Underscores the continued intensification of sophisticated attacks and their lasting impact on business operations. | **Modified**. Expanded to reference actual incidents affecting Microsoft, clarifying the severity and potential harm from nation-state attacks. |
| 2 | **Security of Our Information Technology** | Focuses on threats to internal IT, including sophisticated hacking attempts, social engineering, insider threats, and the evolving tactics of malicious actors. Notes the challenge of keeping pace with ever-changing threats and technologies. | Maintains the same overall focus but includes explicit mention of the late 2023 cyber incident, describing how unauthorized access can occur via outdated accounts. Highlights how remediation efforts can be lengthy and may not always be fully successful. | **Modified**. Further detail on specific breaches and the complexities of response; more emphasis on real incidents and potential operational disruption. |
| 3 | **Security of Our Products, Services, Devices, and Customers’ Data** | Emphasizes customer reliance on Microsoft’s products for security, especially in cloud environments. Notes attacks against on-premises and cloud systems, zero-day vulnerabilities, and open source software risks. Introduces the implications of generative AI as a new field that could bring unknown vulnerabilities. | Reinforces the same points about reliance on Microsoft’s security, with added detail on the ripple effects when the company’s own systems are compromised. Continues highlighting persistent threats, including open source and generative AI vulnerabilities. | **Modified**. Reaffirms prior concerns, acknowledging additional evidence of external attacks on Microsoft’s infrastructure and the potential spillover to customers. |
| 4 | **Development and Deployment of Defensive Measures** | Discusses the necessity to invest in and continuously improve security measures, software updates, threat detection, and reliable infrastructures. Warns that insufficient efforts or slow patching by customers can lead to reputational harm and liability. | Similar focus on security improvements and timely patching but emphasizes how increased cybersecurity demands could reduce operating margins. Points out that some industries have specialized requirements that raise complexity and cost. | **Modified**. Largely the same topic but with deeper emphasis on cost implications and specific industry requirements. |
| 5 | **Disclosure and Misuse of Personal Data** | Describes risks of storing large amounts of personal data in cloud offerings, insider threats, and misuse by third parties. Warns of reputational damage, legal exposure, and potential constraints on cloud business growth due to data privacy concerns. | Continues warnings about high-profile data breaches and insider threat activities. Stresses that despite improving security controls, data misuse may still occur and could have significant regulatory and reputational repercussions. | **Modified**. Maintains the core privacy/data misuse focus while noting continued, high-profile data breaches and the possibility of failing to detect insider abuse. |
| 6 | **Protecting Information in our Products and Services** | Explains that Microsoft content, including LinkedIn data, might be scraped or used without authorization. Notes that changing legal interpretations could weaken control over data protection measures. | Echoes concern about unauthorized scraping or automated collection of data, reflecting changes in laws or enforcement. References potential adverse impacts on business and financial results. | **Modified**. The substance remains unchanged, but the 2024 version highlights broader potential business harm and legal interpretations. |
| 7 | **Abuse of Our Platforms** | Notes potential for users or third parties to post hostile or misleading content on platforms (LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, etc.). Mentions AI-based impersonation and the risk of reputational harm if abuse is not curtailed. | Reiterates that third-party content can be manipulated or misleading. Emphasizes substantial compliance and moderation expenses, as well as the risk of regulatory oversight and liability. | **Modified**. Similar concerns but additional emphasis on compliance costs, regulation, and legal exposure. |
| 8 | **IoT Risks vs. Broader Product/Service Execution Risks** | Focuses on the proliferation of IoT devices, hardware/software integration, and potential security gaps. Notes that insecure or malfunctioning IoT solutions can harm data privacy, health, and safety, leading to legal liability. | Broadens scope from strictly IoT to a wider range of product/service usage scenarios, mentioning hardware, AI, and the possibility that customers might deploy Microsoft products in high-risk settings. Stresses potential legal claims or enforcement actions. | **Modified**. The IoT risk factor has expanded into a more general risk of product/service misuse and unintended consequences, with longer-term safety and liability implications. |
| 9 | **Issues in the Development and Use of AI** | Highlights Microsoft’s AI ambitions and warns that flawed data sets, biased algorithms, or harmful outputs may undermine AI adoption or cause harm. Mentions regulatory, ethical, and societal implications of AI misuse. | Confirms continued investment in AI but notes heightened risks of offensive, illegal, or inaccurate content. Adds detail on new regulatory actions (e.g., EU’s AI Act), copyright infringement concerns, and the potential for brand or competitive harm if AI is misused. | **Modified**. Expanded discussion of emerging regulations, legal liabilities (including copyright), and more emphasis on risks from unintended usage or customization by partners and customers. |

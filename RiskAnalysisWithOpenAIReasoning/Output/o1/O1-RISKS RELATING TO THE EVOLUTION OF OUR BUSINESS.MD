| 1 | Significant Investments & ROI Risk            | Emphasizes large investments in R&D, AI, hardware, and other services (e.g., Windows, M365, Bing). Warns that new offerings may not achieve expected returns or widespread customer adoption. Also highlights scrutiny over data-handling practices.                     | Continues to stress major investments in R&D and AI platforms, along with hardware. Reiterates the risk of not meeting ROI expectations. Now explicitly incorporates the complexities of technology development and potential release delays into the same risk factor. | Modified. The 2024 version integrates the separate “Developing new technologies” risk and adds new emphasis on AI‐related efforts.                                         |
| 2 | Developing New Technologies Is Complex        | Separately underscores that creating new technologies can be lengthy, face significant delays, and pose substantial risks to revenue and market competitiveness. | No distinct standalone risk. Its content (long development cycles and potential significant problems) has been folded under the “Significant Investments & ROI Risk” factor.                                                                                      | Merged. The standalone risk in 2023 is combined with the first risk factor in 2024.                                                                                       |
| 3 | Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, and Alliances   | References ongoing acquisitions (e.g., Nuance, ZeniMax, pending Activision) with challenges such as integration, compliance obligations, and potential distraction for management. | Updates to reflect the completion of the Activision Blizzard acquisition but notes continuing FTC challenges. Stresses difficulty in achieving synergies, managing external parties, and adhering to compliance and data protection obligations.                       | Modified. Revised to include the finalized Activision deal and highlight regulatory challenges and the possibility of post‐closing modifications.                          |
| 4 | Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Risk | Highlights that acquisitions may not meet expected benefits, potentially leading to goodwill or intangible asset impairments and significant charges to earnings. | Similar caution about potential goodwill impairment. Maintains that changing circumstances (e.g., stock price, future cash flows) could prompt impairment.                                                            | Largely unchanged. The 2024 disclosure reiterates the same impairment concerns with no major substantive modifications.                                                   |

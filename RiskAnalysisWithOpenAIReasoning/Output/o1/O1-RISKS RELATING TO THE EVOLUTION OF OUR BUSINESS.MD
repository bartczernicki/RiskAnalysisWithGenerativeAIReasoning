Notes the challenges of third-party or insider misuse.                  | Reaffirms liability and reputational damage risks but explicitly references potential insider threat activities. Stresses that even with improved controls, undiscovered or unmitigated insider actions could compromise personal data.                                       | **Modified**. More explicit about insider threats and the risk of failing to detect internal misuse.                                                                                                                               |
| 6          | We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others     | Warns that unauthorized scraping or data harvesting—especially from services like LinkedIn—or changes in legal frameworks may undermine contractual or technical protections, reducing the value of Microsoft’s data and content.                                                       | Maintains the same core concern over scraping and unauthorized use of content. Notes that evolving interpretations of data protection laws may further weaken Microsoft’s ability to prevent or remedy such misuse, potentially harming operations and financial results.    | **Slightly Modified**. Broadens the potential legal and operational impacts of data scraping, but fundamentally the same risk.                                                                                                      |

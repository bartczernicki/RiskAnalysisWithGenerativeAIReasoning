| 1          | Cyberattacks and Security Vulnerabilities                                               | Highlights that cyberattacks and evolving threats could reduce revenue, increase costs, lead to liability, and damage reputation. Emphasizes increasingly sophisticated attacks by nation-states and other actors, potential for data breaches, and disruption to customers’ systems and services.       | Similar focus on cyberattacks leading to financial/reputational harm but adds details on actual intrusions, including the attack disclosed in the January/March 2024 8-K filings. Notes that these attacks gained unauthorized access to Microsoft’s IT systems and data, potentially harming the company’s reputation. | **Modified** – Now includes references to specific 2023–2024 security incidents and the potential ongoing impact on reputation and operations. |
| 2          | Security of Our Information Technology                                                  | Discusses threats to IT security, including hackers, state-sponsored actors, social engineering, and supply chain vulnerabilities. Highlights the difficulty of detecting evolving threats, the potential for unauthorized access, and the need for continuous improvement of internal systems and controls. | Similar themes but explicitly notes Microsoft has “experienced cybersecurity incidents” where attackers gained unauthorized access to IT systems. Stresses that adversaries may use AI-driven methods, underscores extended nation-state attack campaigns, and references the difficulty of detecting and remediating incidents.  | **Modified** – More emphasis on actual breaches and emerging technologies (e.g., AI) used by attackers.                                       |
| 3          | Security of Our Products, Services, Devices, and Customers’ Data                         | Stresses the importance of secure products and services, references zero-day vulnerabilities (e.g., Exchange Server), generative AI concerns, and the risk of customer environments being attacked even if Microsoft’s systems remain uncompromised.                                                   | Reiterates the significance of product and service security, mentioning the same zero-day and AI vulnerabilities. Adds references to newly discovered threats and underscores that breaches of Microsoft’s internal systems can directly affect customers’ confidence in cloud and on-premises deployments.             | **Modified** – Continues prior themes but highlights that recent incidents directly impacted customers and that AI features pose new risks. |
| 4          | Development and Deployment of Defensive Measures                                        | Details the need for ongoing engineering of secure products, prompt patching, maintaining threat detection, and supporting customer security. Warns that failing to address security effectively can lead to reputational harm and legal claims.                                                         | Emphasizes the importance of “timely” deployment of updates, advanced threat detection, and broader defensive strategies. Continues to warn of reputational and operational damage if Microsoft lags in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, especially in critical industries (finance, government, etc.).  | **Modified** – Similar focus, but with added urgency on swift remediation and references to more focused response measures.                |
| 5          | Disclosure and Misuse of Personal Data                                                  | Focuses on the potential harm from data breaches, including liability, legal exposure, and reputational damage. Notes high-profile data breaches worldwide and the risk of unauthorized use by employees or third parties.                                                                             | Reaffirms potential for financial and reputational harm but adds explicit mention of “insider threat activities” and the possibility of failing to detect those risks. Stresses that new regulations and public scrutiny increase liability for data privacy failures.                                              | **Modified** – Greater emphasis on insider threats and stricter regulatory environment.                                                   |
| 6          | Protecting Information in Our Products and Services from Unauthorized Use               | Notes that LinkedIn and other Microsoft services contain valuable data protected by contractual/technical measures. Concern that changes in law or a lack of robust enforcement may enable scraping or unauthorized data gathering.                                                                      | Similar concern that legislative or judicial changes could weaken the ability to prevent scraping and other unauthorized data use. Cautions that such erosion could harm competitive advantage and business performance.                                                                                         | **Modified** – Wording updates; same core risk but stronger link to potential negative business impacts from data scraping.               |
| 7          | Abuse of Our Platforms (Advertising, Marketplace, Professional, and Gaming)              | Warns that hostile or inappropriate user activity can harm Microsoft’s reputation and user engagement. Mentions impersonation, disinformation, and illegal activities. Notes the challenge of moderating content at scale and the need for significant investment in people and technology.               | Maintains focus on user-generated content risks. Highlights AI-driven impersonation or disinformation, regulatory pressure for content moderation, and potential liability if platform abuses are not effectively controlled.                                                                                     | **Modified** – Adds references to AI-driven manipulation and the possibility of enhanced regulatory oversight.                              |
| 8          | IoT/Product Usage Risks (2023) vs. Broader Product/Service Interaction Risks (2024)      | 2023 specifically calls out IoT as presenting security, privacy, and operational challenges because multiple hardware/software layers can introduce vulnerabilities.                                                                                                                                    | 2024 broadens the scope, stating “Our products and services, how they are used, and third-party interactions may present security, privacy, and execution risks.” This includes IoT concerns but extends to any misuse or misconfiguration of Microsoft technologies.                                               | **Removed/Expanded** – The 2023 IoT-specific risk is merged into a more general product usage risk, covering a wider range of scenarios.   |
| 9          | Issues in the Development and Use of AI                                                 | Describes potential challenges with AI, including biased data sets, flawed algorithms, or unintended outputs (offensive/illegal). Raises liability, reputational harm, and potential regulatory implications if AI is misused or malfunctions.                                                           | Expands on potential AI risks, referencing new and proposed regulations (EU AI Act, U.S. Executive Order), lawsuits (e.g., copyright infringement), ethical concerns, and stricter oversight. Notes that AI can be deployed in high-risk scenarios and cause significant brand or financial harm.                     | **Modified** – Enhanced detail on evolving AI regulations, legal claims, and the broader societal implications of AI adoption.            |

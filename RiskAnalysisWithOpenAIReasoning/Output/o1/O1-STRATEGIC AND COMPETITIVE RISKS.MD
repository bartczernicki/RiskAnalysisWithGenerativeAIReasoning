| # | Title | 2023 Risk Factor Summary | 2024 Risk Factor Summary | Change |
|---|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Cyberattacks and Security Vulnerabilities Overall | Highlights that cyberattacks can disrupt operations, harm reputation, and result in liability; mentions evolving threats from hackers, state-sponsored groups, and sophisticated actors. | Similar overarching concern about cyberattacks affecting revenue, costs, liability, reputation, and competitiveness; continues emphasizing nation-state threats and sophisticated tactics. | Modified. Overview remains largely the same with more explicit reference to actual cybersecurity incidents (e.g., nation-state breaches) in 2024. |
| 2 | Security of Our Information Technology | Emphasizes threats from hacking, malware, and unauthorized access by employees or suppliers; mentions potential for nation-state attacks and risks from emerging IT practices. | Includes a specific incident (late 2023 password spray attack) that compromised some source code repositories; highlights the complexity of detecting and mitigating threats, including possible use of AI by adversaries. | Expanded. 2024 includes an actual incident and discusses longer dwell times, coordinated attacks, and resource-intensive threat actors. |
| 3 | Security of Our Products, Services, Devices, and Customers’ Data | Stresses that attacks on Microsoft’s infrastructure also harm customers; zero-day vulnerabilities, on-premises software risks, and the challenges of patching. Mentions open source software and AI-driven security vulnerabilities. | Maintains focus on the same risks (zero-day, on-premises, cloud); reiterates that attackers exploit popular products. Expands AI references, acknowledges that major attacks can affect cloud services and highlights open source software and hardware dependencies. | Modified. Same core concerns, but 2024 explicitly references the ripple effects of major attacks and generative AI threats. |
| 4 | Development and Deployment of Defensive Measures | Notes the need for ongoing secure engineering, timely patches, advanced mitigation, and robust security infrastructure; warns that higher security costs can affect margins. | Emphasizes faster deployment of patches and continuous security improvements. Points out that failures to address vulnerabilities, including third-party components, can hurt reputation and operational results. | Slightly Expanded. 2024 reiterates existing themes but places greater emphasis on timely patch management and third-party ecosystem security. |
| 5 | Disclosure and Misuse of Personal Data | Warns that storing large volumes of personal data means potential liability and reputational harm if breaches or misuse occur. Mentions legal/regulatory exposure and the importance of user trust in cloud adoption. | Continues to highlight personal data breaches, adding insider threat scenarios and emphasizing that even improving security controls may not prevent improper access. Stresses potential for higher costs and lost revenue. | Modified. 2024 more explicitly references insider threats and underscores broader concerns about ongoing data breaches. |
| 6 | Protecting Information in Our Products and Services from Unauthorized Use | Mentions potential scraping or gathering of LinkedIn or Microsoft data by third parties and legal uncertainties that could weaken protective measures. | Reiterates that contractual or technical barriers may be insufficient against automated scraping tools. Reflects increased concern about changes in law and interpretation that weaken protective measures. | Slightly Expanded. 2024 more explicitly ties these issues to potential negative impacts on results of operations and intensifies focus on evolving legal frameworks. |
| 7 | Abuse of Our Platforms | Addresses risks that third parties could misuse platform features (e.g., ads, content) for harmful or illegal purposes, potentially damaging reputation and user engagement. | Maintains the same core concern, adding the possibility that AI technologies enable impersonation and manipulation. Notes potential for rising regulatory oversight and liability for content moderation. | Modified. 2024 adds details about AI-driven impersonation and manipulation, with greater focus on regulatory exposure. |
| 8 | IoT and Broader Product Use Cases (2023) vs. Product/Services Execution Risks (2024) | 2023 specifically calls out IoT security, privacy, and operational concerns, including multiple hardware/software layers and potential harm if IoT systems fail or are misused. | 2024 broadens beyond IoT to highlight that any misuse of Microsoft products or third-party integrations can pose security, privacy, and execution risks, including personal health/safety impacts and data collection issues. | Consolidated/Expanded. The IoT section transforms into a more general product-and-service risk category, incorporating IoT scenarios under a broader umbrella. |
| 9 | Issues in the Development and Use of AI | Discusses integration of AI in services, potential flaws in algorithms, biases in datasets, and harmful content generation; warns of brand damage if AI is misused or controversies arise. | Reinforces concerns about flawed AI algorithms, potential for legal or regulatory repercussions, ethical challenges, and especially focuses on copyright and IP issues. References proposed AI regulations like the EU AI Act and emerging U.S. policies. | Expanded. 2024 highlights new legislative/regulatory developments, increased liability, and broader ethical implications associated with AI adoption. |

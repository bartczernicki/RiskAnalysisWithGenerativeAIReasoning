| 1 | Significant Investments and AI                     | Microsoft invests heavily in the development and marketing of existing and new technologies (including Windows, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn), with a specific emphasis on AI platform services. Success depends on factors like innovation, distribution, and marketing. Low customer adoption or engagement (e.g., for products like Microsoft Edge, Bing, Bing Chat) and regulatory scrutiny related to data handling practices could harm revenue and reputation. Developing new technologies is also complex, potentially leading to delays and setbacks.                                 | Continues to focus on substantial investments in both existing and new offerings, including AI platform services, with a broader emphasis on developing hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment. Mentions the speculative nature of new technology investments and the risk of low engagement in features that drive monetization. Data-handling scrutiny remains a concern, and the complexity of technology development can result in significant delays.                                                         | **Modified.** The 2024 version is more generalized with fewer specific product references (e.g., Microsoft Edge or Bing Chat) but retains emphasis on AI, data-handling scrutiny, and the complexity of new technology.                                                                                                                               |
| 2 | Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, and Strategic Alliances | Ongoing acquisitions (ZeniMax Media, Nuance, pending Activision Blizzard), joint ventures, and alliances (including OpenAI). Risks include failing to meet strategic objectives, difficulties integrating new employees and technologies, new compliance obligations, distraction of management, and potential for early termination or renegotiation. Benefits may be delayed or smaller than expected.                                                                                                                                         | Highlights continued acquisition activity (e.g., completion of Activision Blizzard in 2023, ongoing partnership with OpenAI) and the attendant challenges: meeting strategic goals, regulatory and compliance complexity, integration issues, and risk of distraction. Notes that acquisitions may be challenged even after completion (e.g., the FTC challenge to Activision Blizzard), potentially altering or unwinding transactions.                                                                                                                                   | **Modified.** The 2024 update acknowledges the completed Activision Blizzard transaction and focuses more on regulatory challenges, including the risk of post-completion challenges by authorities like the FTC.                                                                                                                                |
| 3 | Impairment of Goodwill or Intangible Assets        | Acquisitions may not deliver anticipated economic benefits, leading to potential goodwill or intangible asset impairment. Events such as a decline in market capitalization or weaker future cash flow estimates trigger impairment testing. Past impairments have occurred, and the risk persists that future impairments could negatively affect results of operations. | Essentially the same risk regarding potential impairments of goodwill or intangible assets if acquisitions do not yield expected benefits or if market conditions decline. The Company continues to test goodwill annually and may have to record substantial charges if impairments occur.                                                                                          | **No significant change.** The wording and substance remain similar from 2023 to 2024, emphasizing the ongoing risk of goodwill or intangible asset impairment.                                                                                                                                         |

Below is a structured set of recommendations that apply the five primary components of the COSO ERM framework—(1) Governance & Culture, (2) Strategy & Objective Setting, (3) Performance, (4) Review & Revision, and (5) Information, Communication, & Reporting—to help mitigate each of the identified risk factors. The goal is to embed risk management into strategic, operational, and compliance processes so that Microsoft can monitor, anticipate, and respond quickly to evolving risks.

Below is a sample approach for integrating the COSO ERM framework into your risk mitigation strategies. The table groups recommendations by risk factor and highlights how each aligns with key COSO ERM components (Governance & Culture, Strategy & Objective-Setting, Performance, Review & Revision, and Information, Communication & Reporting).

HOW THIS ALIGNS WITH COSO ERM

• Governance & Culture: Reinforces tone at the top and accountability through designated committees and clear policies.  
• Strategy & Objective-Setting: Integrates risk perspectives into strategic planning, aligning risk appetite with business objectives.  
• Performance: Operationalizes controls and processes (e.g., AI model validation, cybersecurity incident response, sustainability audits), continuously monitoring performance against stated objectives.  
• Review & Revision: Emphasizes learning from risk events and adapting as threats or regulatory landscapes evolve.  
• Information, Communication & Reporting: Ensures timely, transparent disclosure of risk information to leadership, stakeholders, and regulators, underlining the importance of data-driven decision-making.  

By weaving these mitigation measures into everyday processes, Microsoft can strengthen its enterprise risk management posture and remain agile in addressing unfolding geopolitical, market, and technology-driven uncertainties.

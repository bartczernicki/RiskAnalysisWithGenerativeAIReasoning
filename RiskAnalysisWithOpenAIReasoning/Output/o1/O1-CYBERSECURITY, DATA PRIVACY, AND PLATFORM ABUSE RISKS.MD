| # | Title | 2023 Risk Factor Summary | 2024 Risk Factor Summary | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Significant Investments in Products and Services** | Emphasizes the substantial R&D and marketing investments (Windows, Microsoft 365, Bing, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, AI, and hardware). Notes speculative nature of new technologies, long development cycles, and potential for reduced margins or delayed revenues. Mentions data handling scrutiny and risk of negative public perception. Also includes a paragraph highlighting complexities in developing new technologies. | Continues focus on heavy investments, including AI platform services and integrations. Stresses speculative nature, potential for lower operating margins, and delayed revenues. Retains emphasis on data-handling scrutiny and negative public perception. Explicitly acknowledges complexity of technology development and potential delays or quality issues. | **Modified.** Core themes remain the same, but language is streamlined. 2024 maintains the emphasis on AI integration and provides a more concise mention of product feature engagement. “Developing new technologies” is folded into the same heading but remains a central point of risk. |
| 2 | **Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, and Strategic Alliances** | References multiple recent and pending deals: ZeniMax (2021), Nuance (2022), and planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Highlights difficulties in integration, compliance, and the possibility that deals may not close or deliver expected benefits. Mentions OpenAI partnership expansion. | Updated to note completion of the Activision Blizzard deal in October 2023, in addition to the earlier Nuance and OpenAI updates. Emphasizes ongoing regulatory challenges, specifically the FTC potentially unwinding the Activision Blizzard transaction. Notes difficulty in controlling third-party partners and aligning them with Microsoft policies. | **Modified.** Reflects the completion of significant acquisitions (Activision Blizzard) and introduces the possibility of post-close regulatory challenges. The fundamental risk (integration, compliance, and realizing synergies) is unchanged but expanded to include regulatory uncertainties. |
| 3 | **Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment** | Warns that if recent acquisitions or intangible assets do not provide expected economic benefits, goodwill may be impaired. Notes annual testing for impairment, with possible substantial charges if impairments occur. | Maintains the potential risk of impairment from acquisitions if anticipated benefits are not realized. Continues to outline the same triggers for testing goodwill and possible resulting charges. | **Unchanged.** Content is substantially the same, reiterating the risk of impairment and associated financial impacts without new or removed elements. |

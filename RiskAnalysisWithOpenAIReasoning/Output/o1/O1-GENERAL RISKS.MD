| 1          | Damage to Reputation or Brand                                    | Emphasizes potential harm if brand perception is negatively impacted by product issues, environmental or human-rights concerns, or controversies over public policy positions. Negative publicity can reduce revenue and hamper talent acquisition.       | Retains emphasis on product safety, data privacy, and public scrutiny, but now specifically references corporate philanthropic initiatives, AI development/deployment, and “responsible AI failures” as additional risks to reputation and brand.       | **Modified**. Expanded scope to include philanthropy, AI, and “responsible AI” concerns as potential triggers for reputational harm.                                                                                                                 |
| 2          | Adverse Economic or Market Conditions                           | Discusses how inflation, recession, or other negative economic trends lower IT spending, reduce demand for PCs and devices, and strain channel partners. Also highlights risks to Microsoft’s investment portfolio if financial markets decline.            | Continues to address threats from inflation, recession, and reduced demand, with largely similar reasoning. Reinforces the effect on “results of operations” and reiterates potential impact on partners, OEMs, and the investment portfolio.             | **Modified**. Core risk remains the same, with minor wording shifts emphasizing potential impacts on “results of operations.”                                                                                                                            |
| 3          | Catastrophic Events or Geopolitical Conditions                  | Notes that earthquakes, weather events, cyberattacks, and terrorism can disrupt critical operations and supply chains, including cloud services, potentially harming sales, service delivery, and overall business continuity.                             | Adds focus on supply chain disruption explicitly. Reaffirms the importance of business continuity planning and resilience, noting that prolonged cloud service outages can significantly harm business operations and results.                           | **Modified**. More explicit mention of supply chain risks and business continuity in 2024.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4          | Occurrence of Regional Epidemics or a Global Pandemic           | Focuses on how events like COVID-19 can adversely affect operations, financial condition, and results, and may intensify other risks. Managing pandemic responses can drive costs higher and negatively affect sales, revenue, and employee well-being.     | Maintains the core message about pandemics disrupting operations and finances, adding reference to the potential broader impact on “business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.” Emphasizes the uncertain duration and scope. | **Modified**. Primarily a wording shift to more explicitly include “business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations,” with the same fundamental concern about pandemics.                                                      |
| 5          | Long-Term Effects of Climate Change                             | States that the ramifications of climate change on the global economy and IT industry remain unclear. Notes possible impacts on resource availability, regulatory burdens, and higher costs for powering and cooling data centers.                         | Substantively the same discussion of unclear long-term climate effects, plus continued references to rising costs and uncertain regulations. Mentions the potential for energy and resource constraints affecting operations.                           | **Mostly Unchanged**. Slightly updated language regarding resource availability, but the fundamental risk remains the same.                                                                                                                              |
| 6          | Global Business Exposes Company to Operational and Economic Risks| Highlights that selling worldwide is subject to local economic conditions, geopolitical disputes, currency fluctuations, protectionist trade policies, and regulatory challenges. These can affect revenue, supply chains, and profitability.              | Similar coverage, but further underscores that a significant portion of revenue comes from international sales, and that continuing or escalating trade restrictions, tariffs, or regulatory changes pose ongoing threats to operations and profitability. | **Modified**. Adds emphasis on the importance of international revenue and evolving trade/regulatory risks, but overall risk profile is unchanged.                                                                                                       |
| 7          | Dependence on Attracting and Retaining Talented Employees       | Stresses the importance of recruiting and retaining top talent, highlighting competitive labor markets, restrictions on immigration, and the need for diverse skill sets. Unionization, higher labor costs, or turnover could hinder business and innovation.| Retains the focus on a highly competitive labor market and diversity needs while adding specific language about employee training. Continues to note immigration constraints and unionization as potential factors that can affect recruiting and retention.| **Modified**. Adds “training” to talent needs and maintains emphasis on brand, reputation, and immigration constraints as critical factors in attracting and retaining a skilled workforce.                                                              |

| 1 | Reputation and Brand Damage                          | Emphasizes risks to reputation and brand from product safety/quality, environmental impact, supply chain practices, or human rights. Mentions backlash from customers/government over product decisions or public policy stances, user privacy/data practices, content moderation, etc. Social media magnifies negative events.                                                                                           | Similar emphasis on global reputation and brand importance. Adds potential backlash from corporate philanthropic initiatives and specifically references “development and deployment of AI” and “responsible AI failures.” Social media is again noted as accelerating negative brand events.                                                                                                            | Modified. The 2024 version adds references to philanthropic initiatives and AI-related activities (development, deployment, responsible AI), expanding the scope of potential reputational risks.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2 | Adverse Economic or Market Conditions               | Discusses potential harm from inflation, recession, or changes in economic conditions, including reduced IT spending and lower device demand. Highlights risk if partners (OEMs, distributors, retailers) face disruption. Notes increased allowances for doubtful accounts in poor economic conditions. Also covers potential market/credit risks in investment portfolio, especially related to U.S. government securities.               | Similar overall concern about inflation, recession, or pandemic effects on IT spending and device demand. Continues the point that partner network disruptions (bankruptcies, etc.) can hamper sales. Investment portfolio risk remains important, including the possibility of U.S. government debt rating downgrades that could trigger valuation declines.                                     | Modified. The language is largely similar, but expands the potential adverse impacts beyond “consolidated financial statements” to “financial condition and results of operations.” The fundamental risks remain the same, with slight shifts in phrasing.                                                                                                                       |
| 3 | Catastrophic Events or Geopolitical Conditions      | Warns of disruption or failure from earthquakes, weather events, cyberattacks, terrorism, pandemics, etc. Could affect operations, sales, or critical functions. Notes that the Seattle area and Silicon Valley are seismically active. Addresses geopolitical issues (e.g., conflict in Ukraine) leading to economic disruptions, sanctions, and uncertainty in customer spending.                                       | Reiterates major-event disruptions (natural disasters, cyberattacks, terrorism, pandemics) and their impact on systems, supply chain, and the ability to operate normally. Again highlights the Ukraine conflict. Emphasizes that both direct and indirect economic and market disruptions may occur and that supply chain delays could hamper hardware manufacturing or service delivery.             | Modified. The 2024 text adds stronger language around supply chain disruptions and more detail on both direct and indirect effects of conflicts. Continues emphasis on catastrophic event preparedness and resilience.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4 | Regional Epidemics or Global Pandemic               | Mentions how a pandemic like COVID-19 may adversely affect operations, financial performance, and future business, depending on the duration and severity. Notes containment measures may exacerbate other risk factors.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Essentially the same focus: a global pandemic could disrupt normal operations, harm financial condition, and accentuate other risk factors. Highlights that financial market stability and budget decisions remain dependent on the pandemic’s overall severity and response.                                                                                                                  | Modified. Wording remains very similar, though 2024 explicitly specifies impact on “business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.” Overall risk exposure remains the same.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 5 | Long-Term Effects of Climate Change                 | States the effects on the global economy and IT industry are unclear. Points out environmental regulations or resource constraints could drive up costs for goods, services, and energy. Notes climate changes where Microsoft operates may increase power/cooling costs for data centers.                                                                                                                 | Maintains the same core concerns: regulatory changes, resource constraints, and potential cost increases for power and cooling. Continues to highlight that the ultimate long-term impact on IT is uncertain.                                                                                                                                                                              | Largely unchanged. Both years convey uncertainty around climate change’s impact and potential rising operational costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 6 | Global Business Exposure to Operational/Economic Risk | Highlights that a significant portion of revenue comes from international sales. Exposes Microsoft to currency fluctuations, political/military disputes, inflation, recession, and challenges in developing markets (e.g., staffing, management). Mentions rising protectionist measures, nationalistic policies, and human rights or environmental concerns impacting trade and investment decisions.                                     | Maintains similar themes such as currency fluctuations, geopolitical tensions, protectionist policies, and potential restrictions on local sourcing. Stresses that these factors can affect the ability to do business abroad, raise operating costs, and reduce demand for products/services.                                                                                           | Substantially the same. 2024 consolidates language around “global, regional, and local economic developments,” but the underlying risks are unchanged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7 | Talent Attraction and Retention                     | Emphasizes the importance of a diverse, highly skilled workforce. Warns that competition for talent is fierce, and restrictive immigration policies hamper recruiting. Notes unionization risks, costs, and the need for effective succession planning to ensure smooth leadership transitions.                                                                                                           | Similar emphasis. Mentions attracting, training, and retaining talented employees. Includes “restraints on the flow of technical and professional talent,” e.g., from changes in U.S. immigration law. Continues to note that unionization could increase costs and complicate workforce relations, and that effective succession planning is crucial.                                         | Modified. The 2024 version specifically adds “training” as part of talent management and explicitly references “restraints on the flow of technical and professional talent” as a primary concern. The core themes remain the same.                                                                                                                                                 |

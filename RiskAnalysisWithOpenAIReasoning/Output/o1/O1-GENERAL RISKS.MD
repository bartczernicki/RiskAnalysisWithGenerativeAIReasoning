|---|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Damage to Reputation/Brands                              | Highlights that brand/reputation damage from product quality, sustainability, privacy decisions, or partner actions can negatively impact revenue, margins, and employee recruitment. Social media can amplify negative events.           | Similar emphasis on brand/reputation harm but explicitly adds potential backlash from “corporate philanthropic initiatives” and “responsible AI failures”. Mentions the impact on “results of operations” and underscores AI and philanthropy as new concerns. | **Modified** – Expanded language on philanthropic initiatives and AI, reflecting emerging brand and reputation concerns.          |
| 2 | Adverse Economic/Market Conditions                       | Warns of lower IT spending due to inflation, recession, or other factors. Declines in demand for PCs, servers, or other devices and inability of customers to pay can harm revenue. Economic strain on partners or retailers may disrupt distribution. | Substantially the same points on inflation, recession, and declining device demand impacting results. Continues to link deteriorating customer creditworthiness and partner bankruptcies to sales disruptions. Focuses on impact to “results of operations”.            | **Modified** – Largely the same risk with minor wording updates (e.g., “results of operations” vs. “operating results”).           |
| 3 | Product Distribution System Reliance                     | Relies heavily on OEMs, retail networks, and partners. Economic conditions affecting these partners (e.g., bankruptcy) could cause sales channel disruption.                                                                              | Same focus on OEMs and partner networks for distribution, with potential channel disruption if major partners face insolvency or financial issues.                                                                                                           | **Unchanged** – Core content remains the same, noting potential partner bankruptcies or economic issues.                         |
| 4 | Investment Portfolio Risks                               | Holds various types of investments subject to credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks. A decline in global financial markets or a U.S. government credit downgrade could require impairment charges affecting financial statements. | Maintains a portfolio subject to similar global market and credit risks. Again notes potential impairment for investments if U.S. government debt is downgraded or markets decline, now referring to adverse effects on “financial condition and results.”        | **Modified** – Mostly similar with slight wording changes emphasizing potential effect on “financial condition and results.”      |
| 5 | Catastrophic Events/Geopolitical Disruptions             | Disruptions from earthquakes, weather events, cyberattacks, terrorism, pandemics, etc., could harm operations in critical locations (Seattle, Silicon Valley), interrupting services and causing outages that affect business continuity.      | Adds “or supply chain” to the list of potential failures and underscores that such events could also “adversely affect our results of operations.” Emphasizes the importance of business continuity and resilience for cloud services.                            | **Modified** – Additional emphasis on supply chain disruptions and results of operations, but core risk remains the same.         |
| 6 | Abrupt Political Change/Terrorism/Armed Conflict         | Addresses the risk of conflicts (e.g., Ukraine) and other political upheavals causing economic disruption, sanction risks, supply chain issues, and uncertainty in customer technology investments.                                           | Similar view of armed conflict and political tension but highlights potential cost increases, collection challenges, and broader indirect disruptions. Stresses changing regulations and sanctions that can affect business strategy and profitability.            | **Modified** – More explicit detail on indirect disruptions, operating cost impacts, and sanctions.                              |
| 7 | Regional Epidemics/Global Pandemic (e.g., COVID-19)      | States that pandemics can harm operations, financial condition, and results. Duration, severity, and governmental actions may influence spending, global markets, and could worsen other listed risks.                                       | Maintains the same pandemic risks, mentioning how containment measures intensify related adverse conditions. Now also references broader “business” impact beyond operations and finance, reinforcing the risk of recession or market instability.               | **Modified** – Slight addition of language about extended business impacts, but core concern remains similar.                     |
| 8 | Climate Change Effects                                   | Notes uncertainty about long-term impacts on global economy and IT. Climate change could alter energy availability, raise costs (e.g., cooling servers), and lead to environmental regulations affecting operations.                          | Same recognition of climate change’s unclear long-term effects, especially for IT. Emphasizes environmental regulations could impact energy costs and supply chains for hardware.                                                                                | **Unchanged** – Essentially the same concerns regarding climate and related regulations.                                         |
| 9 | Global Business Exposure to Operational/Economic Risks   | Explains that international sales create exposure to local economic, currency, labor, and political uncertainties. Protectionism, populism, and shifting trade policies could impose tariffs, sourcing restrictions, export controls, etc.      | Largely reiterates the same concerns about foreign exchange fluctuations, emerging market instability, and trade barriers. Still emphasizes hedging strategies but notes that significant currency changes can harm results of operations.                          | **Unchanged** – Main points persist, with minor wording differences.                                                             |
| 10 | Dependence on Attracting/Retaining Talented Employees   | Stresses the need for diverse, highly skilled talent. Immigration restrictions, unionization, or inability to staff R&D or leadership roles may hinder product development. Succession planning is critical.                                   | Similar focus on hiring and retention but adds language around “training” employees. Continues to note competitive talent market, immigration barriers, and potential unionization impacts on cost and flexibility. Emphasizes brand and inclusivity.               | **Modified** – Acknowledges training as well as attracting talent and slightly expands on unionization and immigration details.   |

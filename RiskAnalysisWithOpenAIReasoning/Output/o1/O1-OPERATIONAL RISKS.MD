| 1 | Significant Investments May Not Achieve Returns                       | Focuses on Microsoft’s substantial R&D and marketing investments (e.g., Windows, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn) and states that success depends on factors such as innovation, developer support, and distribution. Highlights the risk of not achieving expected revenue from new products and the possibility of lower margins.       | Continues emphasizing the company’s heavy investments (especially in AI), with a shorter specific product list and note that new products may not achieve historical operating margins. Mentions ongoing scrutiny of data-handling practices and how negative perceptions could impact adoption.                                                          | **Modified** – The overall risk remains the same, but the 2024 version is more concise in listing products, highlights AI investments, and removes certain references like HoloLens. The focus on potential negative perception of data practices remains.                   |
| 2 | Complexity and Delays in Developing New Technologies                 | Stresses that new technology development is complex, with long testing periods. Highlights that significant delays in new releases or major issues in creating new offerings could negatively affect revenue.                                                                                                                                                        | Maintains that developing new technologies can be lengthy and complex, risking significant delays or problems. Emphasizes that such issues could adversely affect business, financial condition, and results of operations.                                                                                                                            | **Modified** – Core risk is unchanged; 2024 text integrates the impact on financial condition more explicitly. The essence – that R&D complexity and potential delays can harm revenue and operations – remains consistent.                                                 |
| 3 | Risks of Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, and Strategic Alliances        | Discusses challenges from acquisitions like ZeniMax, Nuance, and the pending Activision Blizzard deal, including integration issues, return on investment, compliance obligations, and the potential for transactions not to complete. Mentions the possibility of renegotiation or termination if arrangements do not anticipate changing circumstances.                  | Notes continued M&A activity, referencing completed Activision Blizzard acquisition and the OpenAI partnership. Highlights persisting challenges such as difficulty integrating, regulatory scrutiny (specifically the FTC’s ongoing challenge could alter or unwind the deal), and potential that benefits may take longer or be smaller than expected.        | **Modified** – 2024 specifically references the finalization of the Activision Blizzard acquisition and ongoing FTC challenge, indicating increased regulatory risk. The basic list of challenges remains, but the emphasis on regulatory pushback is stronger in 2024.          |
| 4 | Potential Impairment of Goodwill or Intangible Assets                | Explains that Microsoft may acquire companies and intangible assets that fail to realize all economic benefits, thus leading to impairment if certain indicators occur. Notes that goodwill is tested at least annually and mentions the possibility of a significant charge if assets become impaired.                                                                   | Reaffirms the possibility that acquisitions might not realize expected benefits, potentially causing goodwill or intangible asset impairment. Emphasizes the same annual testing and the potential for recording significant charges in the case of impairment indicators.                                                                                | **Unchanged** – The language is nearly identical between 2023 and 2024, retaining the same process for annual testing and potential for significant charges related to goodwill or intangible assets. No substantive revisions to this risk factor.                            |

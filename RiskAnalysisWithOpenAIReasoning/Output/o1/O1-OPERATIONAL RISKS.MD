| 1          | Competition Laws & Market Regulation       | Governments scrutinize Microsoft’s business under U.S. and foreign competition laws, focusing on product design, licensing terms, and potential anti-competitive practices. Enforcement actions could result in fines, forced product changes, or reduced revenue if Microsoft modifies or withdraws products.                                                                             | Similar competition oversight remains, but with added focus on new digital market regulations (e.g., EU Digital Markets Act). Windows and LinkedIn are designated as core platform services, subjecting Microsoft to new obligations. Enforcement can include fines, product modifications, or restrictions on acquisitions.                         | **Modified.** Emphasizes the expanded regulatory frameworks such as the EU Digital Markets Act and new obligations for core platform services (Windows, LinkedIn).                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2          | Anti-Corruption & Trade Regulations        | Subject to FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, Microsoft faces risks of fines, penalties, or reputational damage if employees, vendors, or agents violate these laws. Trade laws and sanctions can restrict the company’s ability to operate in certain markets or its supply chain, potentially resulting in higher costs or lost revenue.          | Largely similar, highlighting the same anti-corruption and trade compliance risks. Notes the EU Whistleblower Directive’s implementation across member states, adding complexity to compliance. References to sanctions, export controls, supply chain regulation, and potential disruptions due to geopolitical conflicts remain.               | **Modified.** Now underscores the EU Whistleblower Directive’s varied implementation and slightly expands on potential operational and reputational impacts.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3          | Personal Data Handling Regulations         | Evolving global laws (e.g., GDPR) on data collection, storage, and transfer increase costs and complexity. EU-U.S. data transfer mechanisms face legal uncertainty. Compliance failures could lead to fines, operational restrictions, and reputational damage.                                                                                     | Similar issues persist, but with heightened risk of service blocking or removal by European authorities and additional obligations under new directives (Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act, Data Act). Non-compliance can lead to higher fines, private lawsuits, and stricter enforcement actions.                                     | **Modified.** Adds possible market blocks by regulators and new EU data regulations. Highlights increasing enforcement trends and higher potential fines.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4          | Expanding Legal & Regulatory Requirements  | Microsoft must comply with a wide variety of laws worldwide, including those on user privacy, telecom, data protection, AI, and online content. Non-compliance could result in fines, forced product changes, and negative publicity. New laws and shifting interpretations can require costly or complex product and business modifications.          | Broadly similar scope of regulation, but explicitly references forthcoming AI legislation (e.g., EU AI Act) and expanded legal demands for user data by government authorities. Non-compliance risks include criminal sanctions, product restrictions, and higher operational costs.                                                         | **Modified.** Includes explicit mention of emerging AI regulations and increased obligations around law enforcement requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5          | Claims & Lawsuits Leading to Adverse Outcomes | Microsoft faces various lawsuits related to products, business practices, AI services, and broader operations. Adverse judgments can lead to financial damages or injunctive relief that disrupts product offerings or strategic initiatives.                                                                                                    | Similar litigation exposure, but adds the potential for more novel claims as Microsoft expands its AI services. Emphasizes that growing offerings may attract new types of legal disputes, which can also result in significant monetary damages or operational restrictions.                                                                  | **Modified.** Adds a focus on AI-related claims and acknowledges the possibility of more novel legal challenges as product lines expand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6          | Business with Government Customers         | Significant revenue from government contracts brings unique risks, including audits, investigations, and the possibility of contract termination without cause. Changes in public funding or contract delays can reduce revenue and negatively affect Microsoft’s reputation.                                                                        | Largely unchanged in scope, reiterating that government contracts are subject to heightened scrutiny, audits, and possible suspensions. Any funding reductions, cancellations, or negative audit findings could harm Microsoft’s financial condition and reputation.                                                                        | **Modified (minor).** Wording is essentially the same but emphasizes potential reputational harm and operational uncertainties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 7          | Additional Tax Liabilities                 | Microsoft is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. Transfer pricing disputes and frequent legislative changes create uncertainties. Unfavorable audit outcomes or new laws could lead to increased tax liabilities, potentially having a material effect on financial statements.                                                          | Core risks remain, but the 2024 filing explicitly details a new $28.9B plus penalties IRS transfer pricing dispute. It also notes ongoing revisions to global tax frameworks (e.g., possible minimum tax regimes) that could increase the company’s overall tax burden.                                                                         | **Modified.** Adds a major IRS dispute involving billions of dollars in proposed taxes and penalties, highlighting heightened risk exposure.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 8          | Sustainability Requirements & Expectations | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Introduces mandates and disclosures around environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Microsoft’s publicly stated carbon, water, and waste goals could become legal or investor obligations. Failure to meet them could lead to lawsuits, regulatory action, or reputational harm.                                                | **New.** Reflects emerging sustainability and ESG-related regulations and commitments not addressed in the 2023 report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

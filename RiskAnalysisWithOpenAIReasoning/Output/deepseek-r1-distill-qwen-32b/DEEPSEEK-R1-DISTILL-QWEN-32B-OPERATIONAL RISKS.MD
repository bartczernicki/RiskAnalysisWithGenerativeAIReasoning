| 1          | Infrastructure Outages and Data Loss | Failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could lead to outages, data losses, and disruptions in online services. Emphasis on energy, networking, and geopolitical factors. | Similar focus but expanded to include water supply as a dependency affecting operations.                     | **Modified**: Added specific mention of water supply as a critical factor impacting infrastructure reliability. |
| 2          | Hardware Quality Issues             | Risks related to defects in hardware products like Xbox consoles and Surface devices, leading to recalls or liability claims. | Combined with software quality issues under "Quality or Supply Problems."                                     | **Modified**: Hardware risks now grouped with supply chain challenges rather than being standalone.           |
| 3          | Software Quality Issues             | Bugs and defects in software could harm reputation, reduce sales, or lead to legal liabilities.               | Expanded to include interdependencies between Microsoft products and third-party services.                    | **Modified**: Added context on how third-party interactions can exacerbate reliability issues.                  |
| 4          | Component Supply Chain Risks        | Limited suppliers for device and datacenter components could lead to shortages, increasing costs or reducing capacity. | Expanded to emphasize competition for limited supply and the impact of AI-driven demand growth.               | **Modified**: Greater focus on AI-related demand as a driver of supply chain pressures.                       |
| 5          | Hardware Defects (New)              | N/A                                                                                                         | Risks related to hardware defects, including recalls and safety alerts, impacting business operations.        | **New**: Introduced as a standalone risk factor in 2024, separating hardware issues from software concerns.    |

| 1 | **Competition in the Technology Sector** | Microsoft faces intense competition across all markets for its products and services. Competitors range from large global companies with extensive R&D resources to smaller specialized firms. Low barriers to entry and rapid technological changes necessitate continuous innovation to remain competitive. Failure to innovate may lead to decreased competitiveness and adversely affect business results. | Similar to 2023, Microsoft continues to face intense competition across all markets. The range of competitors and the need for ongoing innovation to meet changing user needs and introduce new products and services remain critical for maintaining competitiveness and favorable business outcomes.                                                                                                           | **Modified:** The risk factor remains consistent but with updated emphasis on maintaining competitiveness. |
| 2 | **Competition Among Platform-Based Ecosystems** | Microsoft aims to create platform-based ecosystems that foster network effects among users, developers, and the platform provider. Significant competition exists from firms offering competing platforms. Challenges include competing with vertically-integrated models, attracting application developers, and dealing with competing content marketplaces, which may increase costs and reduce operating margins. | The risk factor remains largely unchanged, emphasizing the creation and maintenance of platform-based ecosystems amidst significant competition. Microsoft continues to face challenges from vertically-integrated competitors, attracting developers, and competing with established content and application marketplaces, which could impact costs and operating margins.                                               | **Modified:** Maintains the same structure with slight updates to wording and emphasis.                    |
| 3 | **Business Model Competition**        | Microsoft competes through various business models, including transitioning to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service models while still relying significantly on license-based proprietary software. Investments in AI and generative AI are crucial but entail significant costs. Competitors offering free applications, ad-based services, and open-source software also pose challenges by reducing revenue potential and increasing competition. | Similar to 2023, Microsoft continues to navigate multiple business models, with an increased emphasis on integrating AI and generative AI into offerings. The company faces ongoing competition from free and ad-supported services, as well as open-source alternatives. Maintaining diverse revenue streams while investing heavily in AI remains a critical factor influencing competitiveness and profitability.              | **Modified:** Enhanced focus on AI integration and its implications within the business model competition.   |
| 4 | **Focus on Cloud-Based Services**     | Microsoft's growing emphasis on cloud-based services introduces execution and competitive risks. Success depends on bringing compelling cloud experiences to market, maintaining service utility and performance across devices, attracting third-party developers, ensuring reliability and security, and making cloud services platform-agnostic. High infrastructure and development costs may impact operating margins if growth targets are not met. | The focus on cloud-based services is expanded to include AI services explicitly. Microsoft continues to face execution and competitive risks related to cloud and AI services, including the need to deliver compelling experiences, maintain performance and compatibility, attract developers, ensure reliability and security, and offer platform-agnostic solutions. Significant costs in cloud and AI infrastructure could affect operating margins. | **Modified:** Broader inclusion of AI services within the cloud-based services risk factor.               |
| 5 | **Fraudulent and Abusive Activities** | Users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through Microsoft's cloud-based services, such as unauthorized account access, payment fraud, or violations of terms of service like cryptocurrency mining or cyberattacks. Ineffective detection and prevention measures could lead to revenue losses and reputational damage.                                                                                   | In addition to previous concerns, the 2024 report highlights the risk of AI systems being used in unintended or inappropriate ways. Fraudulent and abusive activities through cloud-based and AI services, including unauthorized access, payment fraud, and misuse of AI capabilities, remain a significant risk. Failure to effectively control these activities may result in reputational harm and adverse business impacts.           | **Modified:** Expanded to include risks related to the misuse of AI systems alongside existing fraud concerns. |

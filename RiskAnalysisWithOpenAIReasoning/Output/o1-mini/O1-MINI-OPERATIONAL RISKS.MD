| 1          | Antitrust and Competition Law Risks             | Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how Microsoft designs and markets its products. Governments, including those in the EU, U.S., and China, actively enforce competition laws, scrutinizing product designs and terms. Actions may result in fines, product modifications, asset devaluations, and impediments to acquisitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Government enforcement under competition laws and new market regulation may limit how Microsoft designs and markets its products. Governments, including the EU, UK, U.S., and China, are not only enforcing existing competition laws but also enacting new regulations like the EU Digital Markets Act, which imposes specific obligations on platform services. This includes detailed scrutiny of products like Windows and LinkedIn, potentially leading to fines, product alterations, and restricted acquisitions.                                                                                                                                                | **Modified**: Enhanced focus on new market regulations such as the EU Digital Markets Act and specific platform services like LinkedIn. |
| 2          | Anti-Corruption and Trade Regulations           | Laws and regulations like the FCPA prohibit corrupt payments by employees, vendors, or agents. Microsoft faces compliance challenges from evolving regulations such as the EU Whistleblower Directive. Non-compliance can lead to fines, criminal sanctions, business prohibitions, and reputational damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Laws and regulations, including the FCPA, continue to prohibit corrupt activities. The EU Whistleblower Directive presents ongoing compliance challenges as it is implemented differently across EU member states. Failure to comply can result in significant fines, criminal sanctions, business prohibitions, and reputational harm. Additionally, the risk extends to violations by partners and agents, potentially affecting Microsoft's business, financial condition, and operational results.                                                                                                                                              | **No significant change**: Both years highlight the same regulations and compliance risks.                        |
| 3          | Trade Laws, Sanctions, and Supply Chain         | Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and regulatory requirements affect Microsoft's global operations. U.S. export/import controls restrict product offerings and supply chain integrations, especially with entities from foreign adversary countries. Conflicts like in Ukraine can lead to new sanctions, trade impairments, and ecosystem disruptions, resulting in reputational harm, operational delays, fines, and increased costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Similar to 2023, but emphasizes the adverse effects on business, financial condition, and operational results. Trade laws, sanctions, and regulatory requirements continue to impact operations globally. Sanctions and trade restrictions from conflicts like Ukraine can lead to reputational harm, operational delays, fines, revenue loss, increased costs, and criminal sanctions, further affecting Microsoft's business and financial health.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Modified**: Enhanced emphasis on the broader impact on business and financial condition.                          |
| 4          | Data Privacy and Personal Data Regulations       | Legal requirements for personal data handling, such as GDPR, impose compliance obligations. Challenges include data transfer restrictions, evolving regulations, and increased costs. Non-compliance can lead to significant penalties, legal claims, and reputational damage. The EU is developing additional data-related laws, increasing complexity and costs for compliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Similar to 2023, with added specifics on regulatory actions. Emphasizes that GDPR fines are increasing and European authorities are actively blocking services. Jurisdictions worldwide are adopting or considering stricter data handling laws, impacting Microsoft's ability to innovate and offer features. Non-compliance can lead to penalties, service blockages, reputational harm, and loss of customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Modified**: Added details on increasing GDPR fines and active blocking of services by European authorities.         |
| 5          | Use of Data and AI Under Regulations             | Microsoft's investment in data and AI is crucial but may be constrained by regulatory developments. Requirements like data sovereignty and localization can increase costs and limit innovation. Non-compliance can result in penalties, operational restrictions, and reputational damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Consistent with 2023, highlighting the centrality of data and AI to Microsoft's services and the constraints imposed by regulatory developments.

| 4 | Focus on Cloud-based Services | Microsoft is heavily investing in cloud-based services, facing execution and competitive risks related to developing compelling products, maintaining service performance, attracting developers, ensuring reliability and security, and achieving necessary market scale. High infrastructure and development costs may impact operating margins if revenue growth does not keep pace. | The focus expands to include both cloud-based and AI services, highlighting execution and competitive risks in delivering compelling cloud and AI experiences, maintaining compatibility and performance across devices, attracting developers, ensuring reliability and security, and achieving platform-agnostic availability. | The risk factor has been expanded from solely cloud-based services to include AI services, reflecting Microsoft's increased emphasis on AI alongside cloud computing. |
| 5 | Fraudulent or Abusive Activities | Risks associated with fraudulent or abusive use of cloud-based services, such as unauthorized account access, payment fraud, terms of service violations, and potential reputational damage or revenue loss if such activities are not effectively controlled. | In addition to the 2023 risks, 2024 introduces risks related to the misuse of AI systems, where AI tools may be used in unintended or inappropriate ways. This includes unauthorized access, payment fraud, terms of service violations, and misuse of AI capabilities, potentially leading to reputational damage and adverse business impacts. | A new component related to the misuse of AI systems has been added, expanding the scope of fraudulent and abusive activities to include AI-related risks.

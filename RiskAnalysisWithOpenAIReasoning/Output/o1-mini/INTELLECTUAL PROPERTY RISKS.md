| 1   | Intellectual Property Protection | Microsoft faces challenges in protecting and utilizing its intellectual property (IP) globally, including combating unlicensed copying and dealing with inconsistent patent laws. Difficulties in ensuring consistent respect for patent rights may harm business and operating results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Similar to 2023, Microsoft continues to face challenges in protecting and utilizing its IP globally, including combating unlicensed copying. The absence of harmonized patent laws remains a difficulty in ensuring consistent respect for patent rights. Additionally, increased engagement with open source software leads to broader licensing of IP rights in certain situations, which may adversely affect the results of operations if IP protection fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Modified:** Expanded to include the impact of increased engagement with open source software and its effect on IP licensing.               |
| 2   | Legal Changes and Licensing Issues | Changes in laws may weaken Microsoft's ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect licensing revenue. Licensees might fail to pay royalties or contest their obligations. Engagement with open source software may lead to broader IP licensing, potentially affecting revenue adversely if IP protection is insufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Similar to 2023, changes in laws may continue to weaken Microsoft's ability to prevent the use of patented technology. The increasing engagement with open source software causes broader licensing of IP rights in certain situations. If Microsoft cannot protect its IP, the results of operations may be adversely affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Modified:** Clarified the impact on results of operations and reinforced the link between open source engagement and IP licensing.              |
| 3   | Source Code Security           | Microsoftâ€™s source code is critical to its business. Leakage of source code could result in loss of trade secret protection, making it easier for competitors to copy functionality, thereby adversely affecting revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure may also heighten security risks as described in other risk factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Similar to 2023, Microsoft emphasizes the criticality of source code to its business. Leakage could lead to loss of trade secret protection, easier competition through copied functionality, and adverse effects on the results of operations. Additionally, unauthorized access or disclosure of source code or other IP could increase security risks outlined in other risk factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Modified:** Expanded to include unauthorized access to other IP, not just source code, highlighting broader security risks.                   |
| 4   | Third Party IP Claims          | Third parties may claim that Microsoft infringes their IP rights. Resolving these claims could involve entering into less favorable royalty and licensing agreements, stopping or redesigning products, or paying damages. Adverse outcomes may include monetary damages or injunctive relief limiting or preventing the sale of infringing products. Microsoft has historically paid significant amounts to settle such claims and may continue to do so.                                                                                                                                         | Similar to 2023, third parties may assert that Microsoft infringes their IP rights, including new areas such as AI training and output. Resolving these claims may involve entering into royalty-bearing data access or licensing agreements on less favorable terms, stopping or redesigning products, or paying damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with customers. Adverse outcomes could include monetary damages or injunctive relief limiting or preventing the sale of infringing products. Microsoft has paid significant amounts to settle such claims and this may continue, potentially adversely affecting the results of operations. | **Modified:** Expanded to include claims arising from AI training and output, and specified royalty-bearing data access agreements.       |

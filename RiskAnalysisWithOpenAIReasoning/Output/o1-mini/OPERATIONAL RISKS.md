| 1 | Operations Infrastructure & Data Centers | Potential for excessive outages, data losses, and service disruptions if operations infrastructure is inadequate. Growth in user traffic and service complexity necessitates substantial investment in datacenters and technology. Dependencies include land availability, energy, networking supplies, and components like GPUs. Risks include increased demands from AI integration, geopolitical disruptions, and evolving competitive/regulatory constraints. Operational failures could lead to contractual liabilities, reputational damage, and financial impacts. | Similar to 2023, with emphasis on handling increased demands from AI services. Highlights ongoing investments in datacenter expansion and server capacity to meet evolving customer needs. Adds mention of maintaining robust Internet connectivity and storage/compute capacity within competitive and regulatory frameworks. Operational failures now explicitly include water supply alongside power, and the potential impacts extend to business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.                                                     | Modified         |
| 2 | Limited Suppliers for Components      | Reliance on a limited number of suppliers for device and datacenter components. Competition for supplier capacity can lead to delays or unavailability of components, affecting sales and datacenter capacity. Risks include supplier constraints, industry shortages, legal/regulatory changes, and supply chain disruptions, especially in Asia. Component shortages or inventory issues may increase costs and impact revenue and operating margins.                                                                      | Continuation of reliance on limited suppliers with added focus on expanding datacenter locations and increasing server capacity to support AI demand. Emphasizes the impact of competitors' usage of the same suppliers and materials. Similar risks related to supplier constraints, industry shortages, legal/regulatory changes, and supply chain disruptions in Asia. Highlights that shortages may adversely affect business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.                                                                                        | Modified         |
| 3 | Software Quality & Reliability        | Software products may contain bugs or defects affecting operation. High reliance on Microsoft's software for critical business functions increases risk. Interdependencies among products and services can magnify the impact of software issues. Defects not fixed before release could lead to reduced sales, reputational damage, remediation costs, product delays, and legal liability. License agreements aim to limit liability but may not withstand legal challenges.                                                   | Similar to 2023 with added emphasis on interactions with third-party products and services. Highlights that customers may use their own or third-party products whose reliability depends on Microsoftâ€™s offerings. The amplification of issues due to these interactions is underscored. Potential consequences of defects include reduced sales, reputational harm, repair costs, product delays, and legal liability, with the same caveat regarding license agreements. Impact is specified to affect business, financial condition, and results of operations. | Modified         |
| 4 | Hardware Quality & Supply Problems   | Hardware products like Xbox consoles and Surface devices are complex and may have design, manufacturing, or software defects. Risks include recalls, safety alerts, and product liability claims, which can lead to significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm. Failure to address these issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs poses substantial risks.                                                                                                                                                        | Maintains focus on hardware product complexity and associated risks of defects in design, manufacture, or software. Emphasizes potential consequences such as recalls, safety alerts, and product liability claims, which could adversely affect business and operational results. The description aligns closely with 2023, ensuring that the same risks are highlighted with consistent implications for the business.                                                                                                                                                  | Modified         |

| 1          | Government Enforcement and Competition Laws | Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Governments closely scrutinize Microsoft under U.S. and foreign competition laws, particularly in large markets like the EU, U.S., and China. Actions by antitrust authorities can result in fines, product modifications, or hindered monetization efforts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Government enforcement under competition laws and new market regulation may limit how we design and market our products. In addition to existing scrutiny in markets such as the EU, U.K., U.S., and China, new regulations like the EU Digital Markets Act impose specific obligations on services like Windows and LinkedIn. These regulations prohibit certain self-preferencing behaviors and limit data use, increasing the complexity of compliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Modified:** Enhanced details on specific regulations (e.g., EU Digital Markets Act) and additional platforms (e.g., LinkedIn) subjected to these laws. The scope of regulatory scrutiny is expanded to include new market regulations beyond competition laws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2          | Anti-Corruption and Trade Regulations        | Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. Compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws is essential, with challenges like the EU Whistleblower Directive adding complexity. Failure to comply can lead to significant penalties and damage to reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. Similar to 2023, compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws remains critical. The EU Whistleblower Directive continues to present compliance challenges as it is implemented differently across EU member states. Additionally, broader references to partners and vendors emphasize the expanded scope of potential policy violations.                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Modified:** Emphasis on "partners" in addition to employees, vendors, or agents, highlighting a broader scope of compliance responsibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 3          | Trade Laws, Sanctions, and Regulatory Requirements | Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affect operations related to trade and investment. Economic sanctions and export/import controls can restrict business activities and supply chains, especially during conflicts like Ukraine. Non-compliance can lead to reputational harm, operational delays, fines, and loss of revenues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. The description mirrors 2023 but adds that non-compliance "could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations," reinforcing the impact scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Modified:** Slight expansion on the potential adverse effects, emphasizing broader impacts on business and financial condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 4          | Data Protection and Personal Data Handling Regulations | Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede service adoption or result in increased costs and legal risks. Compliance with frameworks like the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and GDPR is essential, with evolving rules increasing complexity and costs. Failure to comply can lead to penalties, blocked data transfers, and reputational damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines, or reputational damage. Similar to 2023, but with added specifics on regulatory actions such as European authorities blocking services and enhanced emphasis on GDPR fines and actions taken by data protection authorities. The impact of non-compliance includes blockage of product offerings and international data transfers.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Modified:** Added details on GDPR fines, specific actions by data protection authorities, and the impact on product offerings and data transfers, highlighting increased regulatory enforcement.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

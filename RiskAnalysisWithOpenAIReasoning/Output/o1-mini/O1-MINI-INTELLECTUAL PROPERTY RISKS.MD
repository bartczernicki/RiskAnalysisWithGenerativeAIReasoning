| 1 | **Protection and Utilization of Intellectual Property** | Microsoft faces challenges in protecting its intellectual property (IP) globally, combating unlicensed copying, and dealing with the absence of harmonized patent laws. Changes in laws may weaken its ability to prevent the use of patented technology and collect licensing revenues. Increased engagement with open source software leads to broader IP licensing, potentially affecting revenue if IP protection fails. | Similar to 2023, Microsoft continues to face difficulties in protecting its IP, including software and source code, on a global scale. The lack of harmonized patent laws persists, complicating consistent enforcement. Legal changes may further weaken the ability to prevent the use of patented technology. Engagement with open source software remains a factor, causing broad licensing of IP rights, which could adversely impact operations if IP protection is insufficient. | **Modified** – The 2024 summary explicitly includes the protection of source code as part of IP challenges, emphasizing its critical role in the business.                                                   |
| 2 | **Source Code Leakage Risks**            | The leakage of source code, which contains detailed program commands for operating systems and other software, poses a significant risk. Such leaks could result in the loss of trade secret protection, making it easier for competitors to copy functionality and negatively impact revenue and operating results. Additionally, unauthorized disclosure increases security risks.             | The risk of source code leaking remains critical, with potential loss of trade secret protection leading to easier competition and adverse effects on operations. The 2024 report expands the scope to include unauthorized access or disclosure of other intellectual property, not just source code, further increasing security risks as described in other risk factors.                                                                                                                           | **Modified** – The 2024 risk factor broadens the scope from just source code to include unauthorized access or disclosure of other intellectual property, enhancing the emphasis on overall security risks. |
| 3 | **Third-Party Intellectual Property Claims** | Third parties may claim that Microsoft infringes on their intellectual property rights, potentially leading to unfavorable royalty and licensing agreements, product redesigns, or damages. Such claims could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief, limiting the ability to market and sell products with infringing technologies. Microsoft has a history of settling such claims. | Similar to 2023, with additional emphasis on claims arising from artificial intelligence (AI) training and output. Resolving these claims may involve royalty-bearing data access or licensing agreements, in addition to the previously mentioned outcomes like stopping sales, redesigning products, or paying damages. These settlements could adversely affect Microsoft's operations and financial results.                                                                                                    | **Modified** – The 2024 summary introduces specific mentions of AI-related claims and details "royalty-bearing data access," highlighting new areas of potential IP infringement related to AI technologies.      |

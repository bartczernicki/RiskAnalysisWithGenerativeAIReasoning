| 1          | Damage to Reputation or Brands    | Damage from product safety or quality issues, environmental impact, sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. Backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders due to product decisions or public policy positions. Specific risks include introduction of disliked features, public scrutiny of privacy/data/content decisions, data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners/employees. Social media increases the likelihood and impact of negative brand events, potentially affecting revenues, margins, and employee attraction. | Similar to 2023, with additional risks related to the development and deployment of AI. Includes scrutiny over responsible AI practices and failures. Also adds corporate philanthropic initiatives as potential sources of backlash. Specific risks now include responsible AI failures alongside data security breaches and compliance failures. Social media's role remains emphasized in amplifying negative brand events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Modified:** Added AI-related scrutiny and responsible AI failures. Included corporate philanthropic initiatives as new potential sources of reputation damage.

| 2          | Adverse Economic or Market Conditions | Worsening economic conditions such as inflation, recession, or pandemic may lead to lower IT spending, affecting revenues. Decline in demand for PCs, servers, and computing devices adversely impacts revenue. Economic impacts on partners (e.g., bankruptcy of distributors/OEMs/retailers) could disrupt sales channels. Challenging economic conditions may impair customers' ability to pay, increasing allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs. Investment portfolio exposed to credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, potentially leading to impairment charges affecting consolidated financial statements. | Similar to 2023, emphasizing the impact on revenues and results of operations due to lower IT spending and declining demand for products. Economic impacts on partners and customers' payment abilities remain consistent. Investment portfolio risks continue, with a focus on adverse effects on financial condition and results of operations rather than solely on consolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Modified:** Language updated to emphasize impact on financial condition and results of operations instead of just consolidated financial statements.

| 3          | Product Distribution System        | Reliance on an extensive partner and retail network for product distribution, including OEMs. Economic conditions affecting partners (e.g., bankruptcy of major distributors/OEMs/retailers) could disrupt sales channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Identical to 2023, highlighting dependence on partners and retail networks for distribution and the risks associated with economic impacts on these partners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | No Change                                                                                                                                                                 |

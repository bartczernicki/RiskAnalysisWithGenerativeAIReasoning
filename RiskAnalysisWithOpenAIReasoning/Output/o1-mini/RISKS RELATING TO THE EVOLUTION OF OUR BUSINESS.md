| 1 | **Investment in Products and Services**       | Microsoft makes significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing and new products and services, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and hardware like PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. These investments are speculative, with success dependent on factors such as innovation, developer support, and effective marketing. Risks include potential reductions in customer purchases if offerings lack perceived value, delayed revenue from new investments, lower operating margins for new products, insufficient engagement in features like Microsoft Edge and Bing Chat, and scrutiny over data handling practices. Additionally, developing new technologies can lead to significant delays or problems that adversely affect revenue. | Microsoft continues to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products and services, focusing on developing new AI platform services and integrating AI into current offerings. Investments also include hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, such as PCs, tablets, and gaming devices. These investments remain speculative, with success hinging on innovation, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. Risks involve potential reductions in customer purchases if products lack significant functionality or value, delayed revenue from new investments, lower operating margins compared to historical levels, insufficient engagement in monetization-driving features, and ongoing scrutiny of data-handling practices. Additionally, developing new technologies remains complex, with potential for significant delays or problems that could adversely impact Microsoft's business, financial condition, and operational results.                                                                                                                        | **Modified**: The 2024 risk factor merges the 2023 aspects of investments and the complexities of developing new technologies into a single comprehensive section. It excludes specific mentions of certain products like HoloLens and updates the focus to emphasize the broader impact on business and financial conditions. The language has been expanded to highlight potential adverse effects more explicitly.                                                                                                               |
| 2 | **Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, and Strategic Alliances** | Microsoft expects to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of its long-term strategy, citing examples like the acquisitions of ZeniMax Media Inc., Nuance Communications, Inc., and the planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc., along with the OpenAI strategic partnership. Risks include potential failure to advance business strategies, unsatisfactory returns on investments, increased compliance obligations, challenges in integrating and retaining new employees and technologies, management distractions, and the possibility that announced transactions may not be completed. Success depends on leveraging acquisitions to enhance existing products and services or develop new ones, and on acquired companies adhering to Microsoft’s policies on data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. There is also the risk that benefits from these transactions may take longer to materialize or may be smaller than expected, potentially adversely affecting financial statements. | Microsoft plans to continue its strategy of acquisitions and strategic alliances, with recent completions including the acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc., and Activision Blizzard, Inc. The OpenAI partnership continues in its third phase. Risks are similar to 2023 but include additional challenges such as limited ability to control or influence third parties involved in arrangements, which may affect the realization of anticipated benefits. There is also heightened risk from regulatory challenges, exemplified by the Federal Trade Commission’s ongoing challenge to the Activision Blizzard acquisition, which could lead to alterations or unwinding of the transaction. These factors introduce greater uncertainty and potential adverse effects on Microsoft's business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. | **Modified**: The 2024 risk factor provides updated examples of acquisitions and introduces new risks related to regulatory challenges, specifically the FTC’s ongoing challenge to the Activision Blizzard acquisition. It also emphasizes limited control over third parties involved in arrangements, adding depth to the existing risks outlined in 2023.                                                                                                                   |
| 3 | **Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets** | Microsoft may need to record significant charges to earnings if goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired. This can occur if acquired companies and intangible assets do not realize their expected economic benefits. Factors leading to impairment include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in relevant industry segments. Microsoft reviews amortizable intangible assets for impairment when changes in circumstances suggest the carrying value may not be recoverable and tests goodwill for impairment at least annually. Past impairments have negatively affected financial results, and future impairments could have similar effects. | Microsoft continues to acknowledge the risk of impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets arising from acquisitions that do not yield the expected economic benefits. The factors for impairment assessment remain unchanged, including declines in stock price, reduced cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments. The process for reviewing and testing goodwill for impairment is consistent with the 2023 approach. Microsoft reiterates that significant charges may be recorded in consolidated financial statements if impairments are determined, negatively impacting operational results. | **Unchanged**: The impairment of goodwill and intangible assets risk factor remains consistent between 2023 and 2024, with no significant modifications.

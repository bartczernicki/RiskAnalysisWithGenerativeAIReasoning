Here is the comparison of Microsoft's risk factors from the 2023 and 2024 10-K reports:

| â„– | Title | 2023 Risk Factor Summary | 2024 Risk Factor Summary | Change |
|---|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Failure to maintain adequate operations infrastructure could lead to outages and data losses | Increasing user traffic and product complexity demand more computing power, requiring significant investment in datacenters and infrastructure. Dependence on resources like land, energy, networking supplies, and servers (including GPUs) may be affected by factors such as clean energy transitions, regulations, and geopolitical issues. Operational failures could diminish product quality, leading to financial and reputational damage. | Similar challenges as in 2023, with added concerns about "outages," "insufficient or unavailable water supply," and the growing demand for AI services increasing infrastructure needs. Emphasizes broader impacts on business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations due to potential operational failures. | **Modified**: Added risks of outages and water supply shortages. Broadened potential adverse effects to include business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. |
| 2 | Quality or supply problems may affect our business, particularly in device and datacenter components | Hardware products like Xbox and Surface are complex and may have defects, leading to expenses from recalls or liability claims. Software products might contain bugs, affecting critical business functions for customers. Defects can result in reduced sales, reputational harm, and legal liability. Limited suppliers for certain components could lead to shortages, impacting revenue and datacenter capacity. | Focuses on limited suppliers for device and datacenter components, with an emphasis on expanding datacenter capacity to meet AI demand. Highlights that competitors using the same suppliers may affect capacity. Supply chain disruptions could adversely affect business and financial results. | **Modified**: Shifted emphasis to supply chain and capacity issues due to AI demand. Hardware defects in devices are addressed separately. Expanded on how supply problems could affect business and financial outcomes. |
| 3 | Software products and services may experience quality or reliability problems, magnified by interdependencies | Sophisticated software may have bugs, impacting critical functions for customers. Interdependent products and services could magnify the effects of quality issues. Defects may lead to reduced sales, reputational damage, and legal liability, despite liability limitations in license agreements. | Similar concerns as in 2023, with added emphasis on interdependencies with third-party products and services. Notes that customers may use their own or third-party products reliant on Microsoft's services, potentially magnifying quality or reliability issues. Adverse effects could impact business, financial condition, and results of operations. | **Modified**: Added emphasis on interactions with third-party products and services, highlighting how these interdependencies may amplify risks. Broadened the scope of potential adverse effects. |
| 4 | Complexity of hardware products could result in recalls or product liability claims | Hardware products are highly complex and may have design, manufacturing, or software defects. Failure to prevent or address these defects could lead to significant expenses from recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, causing reputational harm and financial losses. | Reiterates the complexity of hardware products and the risks of defects. Emphasizes that failing to prevent, detect, or address defects could adversely affect the business and results of operations. | **Modified**: Presented as a separate risk factor in 2024. More explicitly states the potential adverse effects on business and results of operations due to hardware defects. |

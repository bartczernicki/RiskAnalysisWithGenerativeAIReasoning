| 1   | Damage to reputation or brands may harm our business    | Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and important. Damage can occur due to product issues, environmental impact, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders who disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage may occur from the introduction of new features or terms that customers do not like, public scrutiny of decisions regarding privacy, data practices, or content, and data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or employees. Social media increases the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. | Similar, but includes "corporate philanthropic initiatives" as a reason for backlash and adds "development and deployment of AI," "responsible AI failures," and "cybersecurity incidents" as potential causes of damage to reputation. Social media continues to be noted for increasing negative brand events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Modified**: Updated to include concerns related to AI and corporate philanthropic initiatives, and introduced "cybersecurity incidents" and "responsible AI failures" as potential risks.          |
| 2   | Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business | Worsening economic conditions may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. Impact on product distribution system, including partners, OEMs, and retailers. Economic conditions may impair the ability of customers to pay, increasing doubtful accounts and write-offs. Our investment portfolio is subject to risks, especially U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline or there's a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating, impairment charges could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Similar content with minor wording changes.

| 3   | Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business | Disruption or failure of systems or operations due to catastrophic events could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing critical functions. Headquarters and key operations are in seismically active regions. Natural disasters could harm our ability to conduct normal operations. Providing more cloud services magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages. Geopolitical conditions like the conflict in Ukraine pose risks of economic disruption, increasing operating costs, impacting our ability to sell to and collect from customers, and causing supply chain disruptions. Geopolitical change may impact regulatory systems and market access. Pandemics like COVID-19 may adversely affect operations, financial condition, and results. Measures to contain pandemics may intensify other risks. | Similar, but adds "supply chain" explicitly to potential disruptions. Notes that catastrophic events could "adversely affect our results of operations." Adds that geopolitical events may "otherwise disrupt our operations in markets both directly and indirectly impacted by such events." Emphasizes the negative consequences of prolonged service outages in providing cloud services and solutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Modified**: Added "supply chain" as a potential area of disruption. Emphasized adverse effects on results of operations. Expanded on how geopolitical events may disrupt operations directly and indirectly. |
| 4   | Long-term effects of climate change are unclear         | The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or sources of energy or resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware used to develop software and provide cloud-based services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Identical to the 2023 summary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **No Change**: Risk factor remains the same.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5   | Global business exposes us to operational and economic risks | Global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Results may be affected by economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, recession, and political and military disputes. International growth involves risks like deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Nationalist and protectionist trends may alter trade environments. Changes to trade policy may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, export controls, making it more difficult to sell products abroad. Disruptions could negatively impact demand, impair ability to operate in regions, or increase operating costs. Currency fluctuations may adversely affect results.                                                   | Similar content with minor wording changes.

| 6   | Business depends on ability to attract and retain talented employees | Our business depends on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment, is important for recruitment and retention. Limited ability to recruit internationally due to restrictive immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies may inhibit our ability to staff R&D efforts. If less successful in recruiting or retaining talent, our ability to develop and deliver products may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is important. Employment-related laws may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility. Increased unionization could result in higher costs and operational changes. | Similar, but adds emphasis on "training" in addition to attracting and retaining talent. Elaborates on restraints on talent flow, "including as a result of changes to U.S. immigration policies or laws."

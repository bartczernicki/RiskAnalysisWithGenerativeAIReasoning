| 1   | Damage to Reputation or Brands May Harm Business           | Our reputation and brands are critical to our business. Damage to them—due to product issues, environmental impact, supply chain practices, human rights records, or backlash over product decisions or public policy positions—could harm our business and operating results. Social media may amplify negative events, impacting revenues, margins, and talent acquisition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Similar to 2023, emphasizing that reputation and brands are crucial. Adds that backlash could also stem from disagreement with corporate philanthropic initiatives. Public scrutiny now includes our decisions related to user privacy, data practices, content, or development and deployment of AI. Social media's impact remains significant for negative events affecting business results and talent acquisition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Modified. The 2024 version adds "corporate philanthropic initiatives" as a potential source of backlash and explicitly mentions "development and deployment of AI" under public scrutiny. Minor wording changes throughout the section.         |
| 2   | Adverse Economic or Market Conditions May Harm Business    | Worsening economic conditions, including inflation and recession, may lower IT spending, adversely affecting our revenue. Impacts on partners (e.g., bankruptcy of a major distributor) could disrupt sales channels. Challenging conditions may impair customers' ability to pay, increasing doubtful accounts. Our investment portfolio, especially U.S. government securities, may be adversely affected by market downturns or government credit rating downgrades, impacting our consolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Similar concerns as in 2023, with economic conditions potentially lowering IT spending and affecting our results of operations. Sales channel disruptions from partner impacts remain a risk. Customer payment difficulties may increase allowances for doubtful accounts. Investment portfolio risks due to market downturns or U.S. government credit issues could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Modified. Minor wording changes, such as replacing "revenue" with "results of operations." No significant changes in the risk factors themselves.                                                                                             |
| 3   | Catastrophic Events or Geopolitical Conditions May Disrupt Business | Disruptions from catastrophic events (e.g., earthquakes, weather events, cyberattacks) could delay sales, services, or critical functions. Our key operations are in seismically active regions. Such events could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Increased reliance on cloud services magnifies the potential impact of outages. Geopolitical issues like the conflict in Ukraine pose economic risks, potentially increasing operating costs and affecting sales and collections. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions, impacting our ability to do business in certain markets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Similar to 2023, but adds that disruptions could also affect our supply chain. Emphasizes that catastrophic events could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations or adversely affect our results of operations. The role of cloud services and potential negative consequences of prolonged outages are highlighted. Geopolitical risks remain, with similar references to the conflict in Ukraine and potential impacts on operations, costs, and ability to do business due to sanctions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Modified. Adds "supply chain" as a potential area of disruption. Emphasizes impact on "results of operations" in addition to business operations. Minor additions and wording changes for clarity.                                             |
| 4   | Unclear Long-Term Effects of Climate Change                | The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in resource availability may affect the cost and availability of goods and services necessary for our business. Climate changes may increase costs for powering and cooling hardware used in software development and cloud services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Same as 2023, acknowledging the unclear long-term effects of climate change on the economy and IT industry.

| 5   | Global Business Exposes Us to Operational and Economic Risks | Operating globally exposes us to various risks. Economic developments, monetary policies, inflation, recession, and political disputes may affect our operations. Our international growth includes markets with risks like deteriorating social, political, or economic conditions. Nationalist and protectionist trends may alter trade environments. Changes to trade policies may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing requirements, export controls, and other challenges. Currency fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations despite hedging efforts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Similar to 2023, with global, regional, and local economic developments potentially affecting our results of operations. Risks in developing markets persist, including social, political, and economic challenges. Nationalist and protectionist trends, as well as concerns about human rights and political expression, may alter trade environments. Trade policy changes may introduce higher tariffs and other barriers.

| 6   | Dependence on Attracting and Retaining Talented Employees  | Our success depends on attracting and retaining talented employees with diverse backgrounds and skill sets. The market is highly competitive. Maintaining our brand, reputation, and an inclusive work environment is crucial. Limited ability to recruit internationally due to restrictive immigration laws may inhibit staffing, especially for R&D.

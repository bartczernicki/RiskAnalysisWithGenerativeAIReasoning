| 1   | Difficulty in Protecting Intellectual Property    | Protecting IP rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other IP globally is difficult; lack of harmonized patent laws complicates consistent enforcement. | Protecting IP rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software, **source code**, and other IP globally is difficult; lack of harmonized patent laws complicates consistent enforcement. | Added **"source code"** as a specific element of IP to be protected.                                                                                              |
| 2   | Changes in Laws Affecting Patents                 | Changes in law may weaken ability to prevent use of patented technology or collect licensing revenue; licensees may fail to pay royalties or may contest obligations.           | Changes in law may weaken ability to prevent use of patented technology.                                                                                                                      | Removed concerns about licensees failing to pay royalties or contesting obligations.                                                                               |
| 3   | Open Source Software Licensing Implications       | Increasing engagement with open source software may cause broad licensing of IP rights in certain situations.                                                                  | Increasing engagement with open source software may cause broad licensing of IP rights in certain situations.                                                                                 | No significant change.                                                                                                                                             |
| 4   | Impact of Inability to Protect Intellectual Property | If unable to protect IP, **revenue** may be adversely affected.                                                                                                                 | If unable to protect IP, **results of operations** may be adversely affected.                                                                                                                 | Changed "**revenue**" to "**results of operations**."                                                                                                              |
| 5   | Source Code Leaks and Security Risks              | Source code is critical; leaks may lead to loss of trade secret protection, easier competition, and increased security risks due to unauthorized disclosure.                   | Source code is critical; **unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other IP** may lead to loss of trade secret protection, easier competition, and increased security risks.   | Expanded to include **"unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other IP,"** emphasizing broader risks beyond just leaks.                            |
| 6   | Third-Party IP Infringement Claims                | Third parties may claim infringement; resolving claims may involve unfavorable royalty agreements, stopping sales, redesigning products, or paying damages; risks include monetary damages or injunctive relief. | Third parties may claim infringement, **including current copyright infringement and claims arising from AI training and output**; resolving claims may involve unfavorable royalty-bearing data access or licensing agreements, stopping sales, redesigning products, or paying damages; risks include monetary damages or injunctive relief. | Added mention of claims related to **"AI training and output"** and specified **"royalty-bearing data access or licensing agreements."**                           |
| 7   | Financial Impact of Settling IP Claims            | Paid significant amounts to settle claims and may continue to do so.                                                                                                           | Paid significant amounts to settle claims and may continue to do so, **which could adversely affect our results of operations**.                                                               | Added potential adverse effect on **"results of operations."**                                                                                                     |

**Applying the COSO ERM Framework to Mitigate Identified Risks**

**Introduction**

The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework provides a comprehensive approach to identifying, assessing, and managing risks within an organization. By applying this framework to the consolidated risk analysis, Microsoft can develop effective strategies to mitigate potential adverse effects on its operations, financial performance, and strategic objectives.

The COSO ERM framework encompasses five interrelated components:

1. **Governance and Culture**

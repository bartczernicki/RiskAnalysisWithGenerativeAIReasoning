| 1   | Investments in Products May Not Yield Expected Returns | Microsoft continues to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing and new products and services, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and others. There is a risk that these investments may not achieve expected returns, profitability, or customer adoption, which could unfavorably affect revenue.                                                                                                 | Microsoft continues significant investments in existing and new products and services, focusing on AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing offerings. Investments are also made in hardware development. There is a risk these investments may not be profitable, achieve expected operating margins, or gain customer adoption, adversely affecting business, financial condition, and results of operations.                                                                                | Modified. Specific product mentions from 2023 are omitted in 2024. The risk factor emphasizes AI investments and potential impacts on business, financial condition, and results of operations. Minor wording changes, but the core risk remains the same.                                        |
| 2   | Developing New Technologies is Complex          | Developing new technologies is complex and requires long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect revenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Developing new technologies remains complex, requiring long development and testing periods. Microsoft could experience significant delays in new releases or problems in creating new products or services, adversely affecting business, financial condition, and results of operations.                                                                                                                          | Modified. While the core message stays the same, 2024 expands potential adverse effects beyond revenue to include business, financial condition, and results of operations.                                                                                                               |
| 3   | Acquisitions and Alliances May Have Adverse Effects | Microsoft expects to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of its long-term strategy (e.g., acquisitions of ZeniMax Media Inc. and Nuance Communications, Inc.). These activities involve significant challenges and risks, including not advancing business strategy, unsatisfactory returns, integration difficulties, management distractions, or incomplete transactions. Success depends on leveraging them to enhance products and services and on acquired companies meeting policies in areas like data governance and cybersecurity. | Microsoft continues to pursue acquisitions and strategic alliances (e.g., acquisitions of Nuance Communications, Inc. and Activision Blizzard, Inc., and partnership with OpenAI). Risks include the inability to advance business strategy, unsatisfactory returns, integration challenges, management distractions, and incomplete transactions. Additional concerns involve limited control over third parties, potential for arrangements to be terminated or renegotiated, and legal challenges to acquisitions (e.g., ongoing FTC challenge to the Activision Blizzard acquisition). These events could adversely affect business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. | Modified. 2024 adds concerns about limited control over third parties, potential legal challenges even after acquisition completion (e.g., FTC challenge), and possible alterations or unwinding of transactions. Expands adverse effects to include business operations and financial condition. |
| 4   | Impairment of Goodwill or Intangible Assets     | Microsoft may not realize all economic benefits from acquisitions, which could cause impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. Significant charges may be required if impairment is determined, negatively affecting results of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The risk remains that if economic benefits from acquisitions are not realized, impairment of goodwill or intangible assets may occur, leading to significant charges that negatively affect results of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Unchanged. The risk factor remains the same between 2023 and 2024.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 1   | Inadequate Operations Infrastructure Leading to Disruptions | Rising user traffic and product complexity require more computing power; failure to maintain sufficient operations infrastructure could lead to outages, data loss, and service disruptions, adversely impacting financial performance.                                  | Similar concerns with added emphasis on AI features increasing demands, inclusion of water supply as a critical resource, and potential impacts on business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations due to infrastructure inadequacies.                                                           | Modified—Expanded to include AI demands, water supply issues, and broader impacts. |
| 2   | Supply Constraints for Components                          | Dependence on limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components; supply delays or unavailability could reduce sales or limit datacenter capacity, with competitors' demand affecting component availability.                                              | Similar issues highlighted, with increased focus on expanding datacenter locations and server capacity to meet AI service demands; supply constraints may adversely affect business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.                                                                        | Modified—Increased emphasis on AI service demands and broader adverse effects.     |
| 3   | Software Quality and Reliability Issues                    | Sophisticated software may contain bugs or defects impacting intended operation; customers rely on us for critical functions, and interdependencies between products may amplify issues, potentially leading to reduced sales, reputational damage, costs, or legal liability. | Similar concerns, adding that interactions with third-party products and services, as well as customers' own solutions, may affect quality and reliability; these interactions can magnify the impact of any issues, possibly adversely affecting business, financial condition, and results of operations.                | Modified—Expanded to include third-party interactions and potential amplifications. |
| 4   | Hardware Defects Leading to Recalls or Liability Claims    | Complex hardware products may have design, manufacturing, or software defects, potentially resulting in recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, causing significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if not properly addressed.                | Similar risk outlined in a separate section, emphasizing that failure to prevent, detect, or address defects could lead to recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, adversely affecting business and results of operations.                                                                                | Modified—Now a separate risk factor with focused emphasis on hardware defects.     |

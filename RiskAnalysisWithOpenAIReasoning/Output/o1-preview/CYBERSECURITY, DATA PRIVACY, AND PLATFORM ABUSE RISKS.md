Here is the comparison of Microsoft's Risk Factors from the 2023 and 2024 10-K reports:

| No. | Title | 2023 Risk Factor Summary | 2024 Risk Factor Summary | Change |
|-----|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| 1   | **Security of our information technology** | Discussed various cyber threats to Microsoft's IT systems, including attacks by hackers and state-sponsored organizations, evolving threats, and potential impacts like disruption of services, data breaches, and harm to reputation. | Similar discussion, but includes acknowledgment of actual cybersecurity incidents. Specifically mentions a nation-state attack disclosed in January and March 2024 filings, with potential ongoing impact and harm to reputation and customer relationships. | **Modified:** Updated to include specific incidents, acknowledging that Microsoft has experienced cybersecurity incidents, and adding details about a nation-state attack occurring in late 2023. |
| 2   | **Security of our products, services, devices, and customersâ€™ data** | Emphasized the importance of security in products and services, threats from adversaries focusing on Microsoft's products, vulnerabilities, customer reliance on security, the role of open-source software, and the addition of generative AI features with developing understanding of security risks. | Similar emphasis on product security, but includes reference to prior attack, stating that attacks on Microsoft's IT infrastructure have affected customers and may do so in the future. Adds that these events could result in reputational harm, loss of revenue, and increased costs. | **Modified:** Updated to reflect that attacks on Microsoft's infrastructure have affected customers, acknowledging the potential direct impact on customers, and adding potential consequences. |
| 3   | **Development and deployment of defensive measures** | Discussed the need to continuously improve security measures, engineer secure products, enhance threat detection, and the costs associated with these efforts. Failure to do so could harm reputation, delay adoption, etc. | Similar content, with minor modifications emphasizing timeliness ("escalate and improve the deployment of software updates...in a timely manner") and noting that customers in certain industries have enhanced expectations. | **Modified:** Slight modifications to emphasize timeliness and customer expectations. |
| 4   | **Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation** | As cloud offerings grow, Microsoft stores more personal data. Despite efforts, security controls may not prevent improper disclosure. Third parties may misuse data. Such misuse could harm reputation and result in legal exposure. | Similar content, but adds acknowledgment that Microsoft may fail to identify or mitigate insider threat activities that could lead to misuse of systems or data. | **Modified:** Updated to include the risk of failing to identify or mitigate insider threats. |
| 5   | **We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others** | Microsoft products contain valuable information protected by contractual or technical measures. Changes in laws may weaken the ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information. | Similar, but notes that such changes could adversely affect business, financial condition, and results of operations. | **Modified:** Slight modifications to emphasize potential adverse effects on business and financial results. |
| 6   | **Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement - Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses** | Users may engage in hostile or inappropriate activity, including impersonation and dissemination of misleading information. Preventing such actions may require substantial investments. | Similar content with slight wording changes. Focuses on negative impact on reputation and user engagement, and potential investments required to prevent or respond to abuses. | **Minor Change:** Content remains largely the same with minimal wording changes. |
| 7   | **Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement - Other digital safety abuses** | Hosted services may be used to generate or disseminate harmful or illegal content. Microsoft may not proactively discover such content. Regulations may make platforms responsible for preventing harmful content. | Similar content, but adds reasons for not proactively discovering such content, including scale, limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. | **Modified:** Expanded to clarify reasons for challenges in discovering harmful content. |
| 8   | **The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks** | Discussed risks associated with IoT products and services, including security defects, data collection issues, potential legal claims, and increased costs or damage to reputation. | This specific risk factor is not present in 2024. The topic is addressed in a broader risk factor relating to product use and third-party interactions. | **Removed:** The IoT-specific risk factor has been replaced by a broader discussion in 2024. |
| 9   | **Our products and services, how they are used by customers, and how third-party products and services interact with them, may present security, privacy, and execution risks** | Not explicitly addressed as a separate risk factor in 2023. | New risk factor acknowledging that Microsoft's products and services, customer use, and third-party interactions may present various risks, including security and privacy risks, citing examples such as IoT and AI products, limited control over third-party behavior, and impacts on health and safety. | **New:** This is a new, broader risk factor added in 2024, encompassing prior IoT risks and more. |
| 10  | **Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability** | Microsoft is integrating AI into offerings. AI presents risks such as flawed algorithms, biased datasets, and harmful generated content. Ineffective AI could result in competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, and reputational harm. | Similar content, but updates include mention that AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including OpenAI. Adds legal risks such as copyright infringement claims related to AI training and output, and mentions new and proposed legislation such as the EU's AI Act and the U.S.'s AI Executive Order. | **Modified:** Updated to include mention of OpenAI partnership, current legal claims related to AI, and new legislative developments. |

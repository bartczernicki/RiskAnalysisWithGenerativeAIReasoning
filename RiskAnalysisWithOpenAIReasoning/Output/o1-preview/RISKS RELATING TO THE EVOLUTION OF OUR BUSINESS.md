| 1   | Significant investments may not achieve expected returns                                      | Continued significant investments in R&D and marketing for existing products (e.g., Windows OS, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn) and focus on developing new AI platform services. Investments in hardware products (PCs, tablets, gaming devices, HoloLens). Risk that new products/services may not be profitable or achieve expected margins. Potential lack of engagement in features like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat. Data handling practices under scrutiny; perceptions of mismanagement could negatively impact product adoption, design, and quality. Developing new technologies is complex and may face delays, affecting revenue. | Continued significant investments in R&D and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, focusing on new AI platform services.

| 1   | Difficulty in Protecting IP Rights Globally                   | Challenges in protecting intellectual property (IP) and combating unlicensed use of software and other IP globally; lack of harmonized patent laws complicates consistent enforcement of patent rights.                                                                                   | Similar challenges persist, including protecting software, source code, and other IP; combating unlicensed use globally remains difficult; lack of harmonized patent laws continues to be an issue.                                                                                 | **Modified** – Added "source code" to the list of IP that is difficult to protect globally.                                                                                                        |
| 2   | Impact of Legal Changes and Open Source on IP Protection      | Changes in law may weaken the ability to prevent use of patented technology or collect licensing revenue; licensees might fail to pay royalties or dispute obligations; increased engagement with open source software may require broad licensing of IP rights; inability to protect IP could negatively impact revenue. | Legal changes may weaken the ability to prevent use of patented technology; engagement with open source software may require broad licensing of IP rights; inability to protect IP may adversely affect results of operations.                                                    | **Modified** – Removed mention of licensees failing to pay royalties; changed "revenue" to "results of operations."                                                                                 |
| 3   | Risks Associated with Source Code Leaks                       | Source code is critical; if it leaks, trade secret protection may be lost, making it easier for competitors to copy functionality, adversely affecting revenue and operating results; unauthorized disclosure could increase security risks.                                                | Source code remains critical; if leaked, trade secret protection may be lost, facilitating competitive copying, adversely affecting results of operations; unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other IP could increase security risks.                          | **Modified** – Added "unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other IP," expanding the risk to include other intellectual property.                                                  |
| 4   | Third-Party IP Infringement Claims and Associated Risks       | Third parties may claim IP infringement; resolving these claims may require entering into less favorable royalty and licensing agreements, halting sales, redesigning products, or paying damages; adverse outcomes may include financial penalties or injunctions; significant amounts have been paid to settle such claims.              | Third parties may claim IP infringement, including current copyright infringement and claims arising from AI training and output; resolving claims may require entering into royalty-bearing data access or licensing agreements on less favorable terms; potential adverse impacts on results of operations. | **Modified** – Added references to "current copyright infringement and claims arising from AI training and output"; specified "royalty-bearing data access"; noted potential impact on results. |

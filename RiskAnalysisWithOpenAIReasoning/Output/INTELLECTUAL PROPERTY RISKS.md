| 1   | Difficulty in protecting IP globally        | Protecting IP rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software globally is difficult. Absence of harmonized patent laws makes consistent respect for patent rights more challenging. | Protecting IP rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software, **source code**, and other intellectual property globally is difficult. Absence of harmonized patent laws makes consistent respect for patent rights more challenging. | Added "**source code**" and "other intellectual property" to the types of IP that are difficult to protect globally.                                          |
| 2   | Changes in law may weaken IP protection     | Changes in the law may weaken ability to prevent use of patented technology **or collect revenue for licensing our patents**. **Licensees may fail to satisfy obligations or contest scope.**        | Changes in law may continue to weaken ability to prevent use of patented technology.                                                                                                                  | Removed mention of collecting revenue for licensing patents and licensees failing to satisfy obligations; streamlined wording.                                |
| 3   | Open-source engagement and IP licensing     | Increasing engagement with open-source software may cause broad licensing of IP rights in certain situations. If unable to protect IP, **revenue may be adversely affected**.                        | Increasing engagement with open-source software may cause broad licensing of IP rights in certain situations. If unable to protect IP, **results of operations may be adversely affected**.             | Changed "revenue may be adversely affected" to "results of operations may be adversely affected."                                                             |
| 4   | Source code leakage risks                   | Source code is critical; leakage might lead to loss of trade secret protection, easier competition, and increased security risks.                                                                 | Source code is critical; leakage might lead to loss of trade secret protection, easier competition, and increased security risks. **Unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other intellectual property also could increase the security risks.** | Added that unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code **or other intellectual property** could increase security risks.                              |
| 5   | Third-party IP infringement claims          | Others may claim we infringe their IP rights. May have to enter less favorable royalty and licensing agreements, stop selling or redesign products, or pay damages. Adverse outcomes could include monetary damages or injunctive relief. Has paid significant amounts to settle claims and may continue to do so.                                          | Others may claim we infringe their IP rights, **including current copyright infringement and other claims arising from AI training and output**. May have to enter **royalty-bearing data access or** licensing agreements, stop selling or redesign products, or pay damages. Adverse outcomes could include monetary damages or injunctive relief. Has paid significant amounts to settle claims and may continue to do so, **which could adversely affect our results of operations**. | Added specifics about **AI training and output** in infringement claims. Mentioned "royalty-bearing data access or" licensing agreements. Noted that settlements **could adversely affect results of operations**. |
| 6   | Settlement payments affecting operations    | Has paid significant amounts to settle claims related to technology and IP rights and to procure IP rights as part of risk management strategy, and may continue to do so.                          | Same as 2023, with addition that such payments "**could adversely affect our results of operations**."                                                                                                 | Added that settlement payments **could adversely affect results of operations**.                                                                               |

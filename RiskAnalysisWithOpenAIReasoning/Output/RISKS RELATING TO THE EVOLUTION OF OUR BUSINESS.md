| 1   | Investments in products and services may not achieve expected returns             | Microsoft continues to invest heavily in research, development, and marketing for existing and new products, services, and technologies, including AI platforms and hardware like PCs, tablets, and gaming devices. The commercial success of these investments is uncertain and depends on factors like innovation, developer support, and effective marketing. Lack of perceived value in new offerings may reduce customer purchases. There are risks of delays in development and lack of engagement in features like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat that drive post-sale monetization. Data handling practices are under scrutiny, and negative perceptions could impact product adoption and revenue. | Microsoft continues significant investments in existing and new products, services, and technologies, with a focus on AI platforms and hardware. The success of these investments is uncertain, depending on innovation, developer support, and effective marketing. Customers may not perceive value in new offerings, leading to reduced purchases. New products may not be profitable or achieve historical operating margins. Engagement in features driving post-sale monetization may be lacking. Data handling practices remain under scrutiny, and negative perceptions could negatively impact product adoption and revenue. | Modified risk factor: The 2024 version removes specific mentions of Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat as examples of features driving post-sale monetization. Additionally, the paragraph discussing the complexity and potential delays in developing new technologies is omitted in the 2024 filing. The overall risk factor remains but with updated wording and emphasis.                                                                                         |
| 2   | Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have adverse effects    | Microsoft plans to continue acquisitions and strategic alliances as part of its business strategy, citing examples like the completed acquisitions of ZeniMax Media Inc. and Nuance Communications, Inc., and the announced agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023, the third phase of the OpenAI partnership was announced. These transactions involve risks such as not advancing business strategy, unsatisfactory returns, new compliance challenges, integration difficulties, management distractions, or potential non-completion. Unanticipated changes could lead to early termination or renegotiation, and realizing benefits may take longer or be less than expected, adversely affecting financial statements.                                                      | Microsoft continues to pursue acquisitions and strategic alliances, having completed the acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. in March 2022 and Activision Blizzard, Inc. in October 2023. The third phase of the OpenAI partnership was announced in January 2023. Risks associated with these transactions include not advancing business strategy, unsatisfactory returns, new compliance challenges, integration difficulties, management distractions, or potential non-completion. Limited ability to control or influence third parties may impact anticipated benefits. The FTC continues to challenge the Activision Blizzard acquisition and could alter or unwind the transaction. These events could adversely affect business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. | Modified risk factor: The 2024 version updates the status of the Activision Blizzard acquisition from a pending agreement to a completed transaction in October 2023. It adds a new risk regarding the ongoing FTC challenge that could alter or unwind the acquisition. Additionally, it mentions limited ability to control or influence third parties in strategic arrangements. The overall risk factor is updated to reflect current events and additional risks. |
| 3   | Goodwill or intangible assets impairment may require significant charges to earnings | Microsoft acquires companies and intangible assets, which may not realize expected economic benefits, potentially causing impairment of goodwill or intangibles. Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances change, such as a decline in stock price, reduced cash flow estimates, or slower industry growth rates. Impairment charges could negatively affect results of operations.                                                                                                                                         | Same as 2023 summary. The risk factor remains unchanged, highlighting the potential for impairment charges due to acquisitions that do not realize expected benefits, with similar factors indicating impairment and potential negative impacts on results of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | No change: The risk factor remains the same between 2023 and 2024 filings, with no significant modifications in content or emphasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

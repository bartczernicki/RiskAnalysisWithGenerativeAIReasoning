| Row Number | Title | 2023 Risk Factor Summary | 2024 Risk Factor Summary | Change |
|------------|-------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Cybersecurity and IT security threat landscape | Highlighted general cybersecurity risks including malware, nation-state actors, and techniques like social engineering impacting Microsoft infrastructure, reputation, and revenue. | Added specific mention of a nation-state cyberattack that began in November 2023, affected Microsoft email and internal systems, and resulted in potential ongoing implications. | Modified: The general cybersecurity warnings from 2023 have been substantially expanded by explicitly including a major cybersecurity incident Microsoft experienced, indicating increased risk awareness and transparency. |
| 2 | Inadequate account and organizational security practices | Cited employee and third-party account security shortcomings leading to vulnerabilities and breaches in Microsoft’s internal environment. | Expanded to include risks from both acquired companies and third-party vendors explicitly, suggesting broader accountability and risk footprint across ecosystems and partnerships. | Modified: Increased emphasis on vulnerabilities originating from third parties, acquired entities, and the broader ecosystem. |
| 3 | Increasing sophistication and complexity of cyberattacks | Detailed threats evolving in complexity, persistent vulnerabilities, cascading impacts, and difficulty of detection in a dynamic IT environment. | Added considerations about emerging technologies like AI and machine learning being used by threat actors, and explicitly highlighted investigation, mitigation, and remediation challenges. | Modified: Addition of emerging technologies used by attackers and greater clarity on challenges in responding effectively to sophisticated cyber incidents. |
| 4 | Security vulnerabilities in products, services, and customer data | Emphasized adversarial attacks on popular Microsoft products, zero-day vulnerabilities, ransomware, open-source integration security risks, and generative AI features potentially introducing novel attack vectors. | Expanded details referencing past incidents and clearly integrated examples of attacks on Microsoft directly affecting customers. Explicitly noted ongoing development of understanding generative AI-related security threats. | Modified: Reinforced with clearer, real-world references to incidents, underscored generative AI risks, and explicitly connected internal cybersecurity breaches to customer impacts. |
| 5 | Customer technical diversity and security defaults | Noted customers operating complex IT systems with legacy or unsupported products, difficulties in securing these diverse environments, and Microsoft limitations in imposing security standards. | No meaningful changes in descriptions or risks outlined. | Unchanged: Minor wording tweaks with no substantial differences. |
| 6 | Notification and support of customers in cybersecurity incidents | Promised notification and support for affected customers, notably for environments (e.g. on-premises Exchange Server) where limited visibility complicates incident response. | No substantial change; Microsoft continues commitment toward customer notification, guidance, and remediation support. | Unchanged: continues consistent policy on customer notification and incident support. |
| 7 | Development and deployment of defensive security measures | Discussed ongoing requirement to enhance security features, updates, and mitigation technologies, especially regarding critical industry demands (healthcare, financial, government). | Described increased urgency around faster deployment of updates and improvements, timeline emphasis, and explicitly highlighted specialized industries’ security expectations. | Modified: Intensified emphasis on faster update deployment and specific industry-centered requirements for higher security. |
| 8 | Risk from third-party components and dependencies | Noted security vulnerability risks within products/components from third-party ecosystems affecting Microsoft’s financial, reputational, or competitive position. | Explicitly detailed potential impacts on financial results (revenues and operations) due to exploitation of third-party components. | Modified: Added explicit mention of adverse financial impacts to broaden potential consequences illustrating material financial risk. |
| 9 | Misuse and data breaches of customer/user personal data | Described liability and reputational risk from improper disclosures or misuse by employees, third parties, insufficient cybersecurity controls, and regulatory or governmental data requests. | Added specific concern about insider threats, emphasizing risk from potential misuse by internal personnel of Microsoft customer and user data. | Modified: Addition of explicit focus on insider threats reflecting growing recognition and concern about internal vulnerabilities. |
| 10 | Inability to protect proprietary information from unauthorized use or scraping | Highlighted risks faced by products like LinkedIn from third-party scraping through bots or other practices, potentially diminishing value. | Clarified potential adverse financial impacts explicitly connected to scraping incidents and misuse. | Modified: Added clear references to adverse business results from improper data scraping, increasing the visibility and clarity of business impact from this risk factor. |
| 11 | Abuse of advertising, marketplace, gaming, and professional platforms | Described reputational impacts from hostile and inappropriate third-party activities, misinformation, including the use of AI technologies and violations of service terms. | Explicitly mentioned potential adverse impacts to Microsoft’s financial condition and operating results. | Modified: Additional explicit linkages between platform abuses and material financial impacts, enhancing perceived severity of reputational risk. |
| 12 | Digital safety abuses on hosted enterprise and consumer services | Discussed harm resulting from use of Microsoft services to disseminate harmful or illegal content, noting challenges in proactive content moderation, potential regulatory actions, and liabilities. | Included more explicit potential adverse impacts to Microsoft’s financial condition and operating results. | Modified: Clarified and reinforced the link between digital safety abuses and potential financial consequences, suggesting increased seriousness and accountability. |
| 13 | Internet of Things (IoT) security, privacy, and safety risks | Focused specifically on risks of IoT products and solutions, including insecurities, difficulty updating, personal health/safety impacts, and data handling challenges. | Broadened this risk to include all products and services, referencing IoT as one example, and emphasizing customers’ improper use or high-risk deployment scenarios. | Modified: Expanded IoT risks into broader hardware/software product categories, highlighting emerging concerns beyond IoT scenarios and explicitly calling out risks of customer misuse. |
| 14 | Issues associated with AI development and deployment | Outlined multiple AI-related risks including reputational or competitive harm, flawed training methods, biased datasets, offensive AI outputs, and regulatory impact, specifically referencing the EU legislation proposal. | Significantly expanded topics including explicit references to current copyright infringement claims, U.S. AI Executive Order, increased emphasis on responsible AI, accuracy issues, broader regulation, and direct mention of governance policies. | Modified: Substantially expanded coverage of risks tied to AI with detailed references to specific and direct legal actions, new regulations, responsible AI practices, and ethical/human rights implications. Demonstrates rapidly growing recognition of AI risks and broader stakeholder scrutiny. |

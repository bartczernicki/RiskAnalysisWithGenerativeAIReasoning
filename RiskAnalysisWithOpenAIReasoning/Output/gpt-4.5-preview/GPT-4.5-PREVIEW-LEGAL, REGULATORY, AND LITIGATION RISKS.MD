| 2 | Anti-Corruption and Trade Compliance | Non-compliance with FCPA, the EU Whistleblower Directive, and increasing international trade laws, sanctions, and export controls could cause monetary and criminal penalties, operational disruptions, or reputational harm. | Maintained similar description emphasizing ongoing regulatory complexity and risk, with repeated reference to EU Whistleblower Directive and added explicit mention of potential negative impacts on financial conditions. | Modified. Reinforces previous risks and explicitly highlights broader potential impact on financial condition and results of operations. |
| 3 | Personal Data Regulations & GDPR | Handling personal data across borders, particularly under GDPR, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), and new EU data laws (Digital Markets, Data, & Services Acts) may impede providing services or cause fines, lawsuits, and high operational costs. | Expanded discussion on enforcement actions, explicitly referencing recent EU measures blocking/removing services and increased fines targeting large tech companies, highlighting stricter enforcement and higher operational risk. | Modified; significantly enhanced emphasis on increased regulatory enforcement, higher fines, and explicit European regulatory actions blocking or removing services from markets. |
| 3 | Evolving Regulatory Requirements | Broader reference to complex regulatory requirements in user privacy, telecom services, cybersecurity, advertising, ESG, accessibility, and environmental disclosure potentially leading to increased costs, compliance complexity, and possible loss of business. | Added explicit mention of new regulatory pressures, specifically rising requests from law enforcement and governments around data sharing, with increasing volume and complexity, raising operational and compliance costs. | Modified to highlight specifically the rise in more complex government data access and law enforcement compliance obligations, and ongoing increases in ESG compliance demands. |
| 3 | Claims and Lawsuits | Litigation risks exist from various ongoing claims and lawsuits which could negatively affect operations and financial performance. | Similar in overall tone, enhanced to emphasize that claims now arise from "a wide variety of business practices," expanding potential scope, and clarifying potential injunctive relief or operational harm from lawsuits. | Modified with broader clarification of lawsuit sources and potential risks, emphasizing operational impact. |
| 4 | Government Contract and Funding Risks | Public-sector contracts may include termination without cause, funding cancellations, delays, or rescission, possibly leading to fines or penalties and reductions in revenue and profitability. | Similar risks maintained, elaborating explicitly risks of being disqualified as a governmental contractor, and broader potential impact to financial outcomes explicitly stated. | Modified to specifically highlight contractor status risks and potential governmental contractor prohibition alongside rescission risks. |
| 5 | Income Tax & International Taxes | Compliance with U.S. tax laws, audits (including IRS), and international tax regulations could lead to higher taxes, penalties, audit difficulties, or changes in reporting.

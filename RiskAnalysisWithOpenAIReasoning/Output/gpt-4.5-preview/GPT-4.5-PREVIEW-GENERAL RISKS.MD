| Row Number | Title | 2023 Risk Factor Summary | 2024 Risk Factor Summary | Change |
|------------|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Reputation and Brand Damage | Damage could arise from product safety, privacy, data breaches, and controversial decisions, amplified by social media and causing harm to revenues and employee attraction. | Similar factors listed as 2023, with addition of risks related to responsible AI development, corporate philanthropy decisions, and cybersecurity incidents. | **Modified:** Expanded scope to include responsible AI failures, cybersecurity incidents, and corporate philanthropy initiatives, highlighting increased awareness and emphasis on emerging issues surrounding AI and cybersecurity. |
| 2 | Adverse Economic and Market Conditions | Economic challenges like inflation or recession may reduce customer spending, negatively impacting revenue. Financial distress or bankruptcies within partner networks could further disrupt distribution and increase accounts receivable write-offs. Economic downturns may negatively impact U.S. government securities held as investments. | Largely similar to 2023, though language slightly clarified to emphasize risks to "results of operations" in addition to revenue. Investment risk description remains comparable. | **Modified:** Slight modification emphasizing a broader negative impact beyond revenue, now specifically referencing "results of operations." Essentially unchanged in scope and substance. |
| 3 | Catastrophic Events and Geopolitical Risks | Disruptions from natural disasters, cyberattacks, pandemics, political instability, or conflicts (e.g., Ukraine) could disrupt operations, increase costs, and harm sales. Cloud business dependence heightens potential harm from service outages. | Similar description to 2023, but now explicitly mentioning potential disruptions to the supply chain and stating “negative consequences of prolonged service outages” explicitly. | **Modified:** Updated to explicitly include supply chain disruption and explicitly name negative consequences of cloud service outages, reflecting deeper emphasis on resilience in operations and supply chain robustness. |
| 4 | Pandemic and Epidemic Risks | A global pandemic like COVID-19 could cause severe harm to operations and financial conditions depending on scope, responses, and market stability. | Virtually identical language to 2023, with clear continuity in recognizing ongoing pandemic impacts as a potential risk. | **Unchanged:** Continuity in identifying pandemics as an ongoing business operational risk. |
| 5 | Climate Change Risks | Unclear long-term climate impacts may increase energy/resource costs and disrupt availability, affecting cloud and IT services. | Description largely unchanged from 2023, emphasizing persistent uncertainties and concerns around costs and resource availability influenced by climate conditions. | **Unchanged:** Continuity and stability in treatment of climate change risk. |
| 6 | Operational and Economic Risks of Global Business | International presence creates exposure to geopolitical, economic, currency, and protectionist policies affecting operations, market access, and profitability. Ongoing global conditions can disrupt operations and impact customer spending. | Virtually identical to 2023, clearly addressing geopolitical and economic risks from global operations and currency fluctuations, emphasizing ongoing concerns with global political instability and market disruptions. | **Unchanged:** Consistent approach to describing international market and geopolitical risks, with minor wording clarifications. |
| 7 | Talent Attraction and Retention Risks | Highly competitive industry necessitates successful attraction and retention of skilled and diverse talent. Risks include restrictive immigration policies affecting technical hiring, increased employee unionization, and ineffective succession planning potentially harming operations and strategic execution. | Similar to 2023, with added emphasis on importance of employee "training," clearer language around potential immigration law changes as specific restraints on talent flow, otherwise largely unchanged. | **Modified:** Slightly expanded to explicitly recognize the role of employee training, and clarified immigration law impacts, underscoring importance placed on skills development and policy implications regarding global talent management. |

| 1          | Protection and Enforcement of IP Rights      | Difficulty protecting IP rights globally due to challenges such as unlicensed copying of software, varied patent laws, licensee royalty compliance, and broad licensing associated with open source software, potentially causing adverse revenue impacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Difficulty protecting IP rights globally remains, specifically highlighting software, source code, and inconsistent patent law protections. Continued concerns regarding licensing broadly due to expanding open-source software engagement, potentially causing adverse impacts on results of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Modified – Removed detailed mention of royalty collection difficulties from licensees. Clarified focus on software, source code, and operational impact rather than revenue impact alone.  |
| 2          | Source Code Leakage and Competition Risk     | Criticality of source code to Microsoft's business is emphasized; leaks could diminish trade secret status, ease competitor copying, and create security risks, harming revenue and operating results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Emphasizes continued criticality and competitive threat of source code leakage. Adds explicit reference to unauthorized "access or disclosure," broadening the security risk scenarios, with specific impact noted on results of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Modified – Added broader language around "unauthorized access" alongside leak disclosure. Shifted explicitly to operational results impact rather than a general revenue and results focus. |
| 3          | Third-party Intellectual Property Infringement Claims | Highlights potential adverse outcomes from third-party intellectual property infringement claims, including costly settlements, less favorable licensing agreements, redesigns, indemnification payments, and possible injunctions affecting Microsoft's ability to sell products or services.                                                                                                                                                                                         | Continues highlighting infringement risk, adding explicit mention of "copyright infringement and other claims arising from AI training and output." Notes potential need for royalty-bearing data access agreements. Highlights ongoing significant expenditures to manage this infringement risk, potentially adversely affecting results of operations.                                                                                             | Modified – Specifically expanded to include new risks related to AI training and copyright infringement. Introduced concept of "royalty-bearing data access" and emphasized operational impact |

| Row Number | Title | 2023 Risk Factor Summary | 2024 Risk Factor Summary | Change |
|------------|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Technology Market Competition | Intense competition from global diversified and specialized firms, rapid tech changes, shifting user needs. Must innovate appealing products and services. | Similar summary with clearer emphasis on innovation necessity; explicitly mentions potential adverse financial outcomes if innovation does not continue. | Modified: Slightly more explicit focus on risks of failing to innovate, directly linking to potential negative operational results. |
| 2 | Competition Among Platform-based Ecosystems | Platforms compete with vertically-integrated models (controlling hardware and software), affecting margins; competition from low/no cost OS platforms and large-scale app/content marketplaces. | Similar content emphasizing vertically-integrated competitors, prominence of smartphones/tablets, and marketplace switching costs, plus explicit caution on potential unsuccessful competition adversely impacting financial results. | Modified: Reinforced language emphasizing ongoing competitive threats, focusing explicitly on impacts on business, operations, and financial results rather than generic margin pressures. |
| 3 | Business Model Competition and Cloud-based Services | Increasing shift towards cloud-based models involving significant infrastructure investment; must develop compelling cloud-based user experiences, support broad device compatibility, reliability, and security. Explicitly mentions IoT strategies (Azure AI, IoT Edge). Concerns over revenue generation versus investment cost. | Emphasis broadened to explicitly integrate AI as core competitive element alongside cloud; significant infrastructure investment in cloud and AI, requirement to deliver compelling experiences including AI products, plus maintaining broad ecosystem compatibility. Specific IoT language less emphasized. Explicit mention of evolving pricing and cloud delivery models. | Modified: AI added explicitly as part of core cloud strategy, reflecting strategic shift towards generative AI services; reduced IoT-specific language. |
| 4 | Artificial Intelligence (AI) Competition | AI investments across products, expecting highly competitive, fast-evolving AI market with costly operational developments, potential future regulatory impacts, and public scrutiny. | Continues strong emphasis on the AI market as highly competitive with substantial operational/infrastructure costs. Explicit reference to "new competitors" entering market, and emphasizes need to respond effectively to regulatory developments and scrutiny. | Modified: Broader inclusion of new competitors entering AI market; regulatory risk and scrutiny further emphasized, reflecting growing importance and public attention on AI ethics/regulations. |
| 5 | Risks of Fraudulent or Abusive Activities | Users may commit fraud/misuse (stolen credentials, payment fraud, cyberattacks, cryptocurrency mining) on cloud services; risks revenue, reputation if detection controls ineffective. | Similar threats elaborated, also explicitly adds risk related to AI product misuse ("unintended or inappropriate" usage of powerful AI systems), emphasizing potentially broader reputational and operational harms. | Modified: New explicit coverage of AI misuse introduces additional risk factor details relevant in 2024, expanding scope beyond merely cloud-service abuse. |

| Row Number | Title | 2023 Risk Factor Summary | 2024 Risk Factor Summary | Change |
|------------|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Online Services Infrastructure Risks | Increased demand for computing power from user growth and new services requires extensive datacenter investment. Risks include outages, data losses, insufficient power, networking, or compute resources, regulatory developments, and geopolitical disruptions. | Increased computing infrastructure demands continue, highlighting water supply risk along with power, land availability, geopolitical, regulatory, and environmental factors. Added explicit mention of growing AI-related service demand. | Modified: Highlighted water supply risk explicitly and emphasized growing AI-driven infrastructure demands. |
| 2 | Datacenter and Hardware Component Supply Risks | Limited supplier base for certain hardware components can lead to shortages, competitive constraints, supply disruptions, industry-wide shortages, and supply chain disruptions affecting datacenter servers and consumer devices assembled internationally. | Emphasizes increasing datacenter location expansion and server capacity to support AI service growth. Reinforces risk concerning component availability due to supplier constraints, competitor demands, and supply chain disruptions, potentially impacting business results. | Modified: Expanded to emphasize datacenter capacity growth specifically related to increasing AI service demands and clarified impacts on business operations and financial condition. |
| 3 | Software Quality and Reliability Risks | Bugs or defects in sophisticated software products, especially given increasing reliance for critical business functions, can cause significant revenue reductions, reputational damage, additional costs, product delays, and potential legal liabilities. | Reiterates the risks, with additional clarity on increased complexity due to integration with third-party products and interactions customers have with third-party services dependent on Microsoft services, amplifying reliability-related effects. | Modified: Enhanced to explicitly detail risks associated with interdependencies with third-party products and customer integration scenarios amplifying the scope of potential reliability and service impact. |
| 4 | Hardware Product Quality Risks | Complex hardware (Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices) may experience defects, leading to recalls, product liability claims, safety alerts, significant expenses, and reputation harm. | Similar identification of hardware risks, clearly connecting defect issues directly to possible adverse effects on overall business and operational results. | Modified: Slight restructuring emphasizes clearly linking potential hardware defects directly to explicit risks of adverse business outcomes rather than separately listing recall or safety claims. |

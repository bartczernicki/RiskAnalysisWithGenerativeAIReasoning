<speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US"><voice name="en-US-Andrew:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.8">Hey everyone, welcome back to the 'Enterprise Risks' podcast! I'm Andrew, and joining me as always is the insightful Emma.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.8">Thanks for the warm intro, Andrew! Happy to be here. So, what are we diving into today?</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.8">Well, we've got a lot to unpack. We are going to look at Microsoft's SEC 10-K reports from 2023 and 2024. For those unfamiliar with 10-K reports, they are basically detailed annual reports that publicly traded companies must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These specific reports from Microsoft have some interesting shifts in their key, high impact, risk factors.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.6">Ooh, that sounds intriguing. Any major risk changes we should be aware of?</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">Absolutely!! For starters, they've placed a significant emphasis on cybersecurity incidents, especially with actual attacks happening, like the one in November 2023.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.6">Right, the nation-state attack they mentioned. That definitely escalates things from potential risks to realized threats.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">Exactly. It underscores the urgency for stronger cybersecurity measures. Plus, the risk isn't just to their systems but also to their customers'.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.7">That's a double whammy. Breaches affecting customers can seriously erode trust and lead to legal headaches.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">Speaking of legal issues, they've also highlighted risks associated with AI, including copyright infringement claims and new regulations like the EU's AI Act.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.6">    Yeah, the legal landscape for AI is getting complicated. Companies need to navigate that carefully to avoid penalties.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">Agreed. Another notable addition is the focus on insider threats related to the misuse of personal data.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.6">Internal risks are often overlooked, but they can be just as damaging as external ones.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural">Absolutely. Probably the biggest risk factor uncovered is "Competition in the AI space". The reports highlight how Microsoft's market leading position with AI has changed. Basically, there is more competition in 2024. They were the only game in town with their exclusive partnership with OpenAI in 2023, but no longer. They need to defend that space.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural">That makes sense. I am a HUGE fan of OpenAI models, but certainly have seen my colleagues talk about Google and even open source AI service offers.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">So, we covered some key risks, how should Microsoft prioritize them?</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.7">Well, prioritization should consider both the likelihood and impact of each risk. Cybersecurity incidents affecting customers should be high on the list due to the immediate threat to trust and legal implications.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">That makes sense. Legal risks associated with AI should also be a priority, given the evolving regulations and potential for significant financial penalties.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.6">Absolutely. And let's not forget about sustainability regulations. Failing to comply with ESG laws could not only result in penalties but also damage their reputation.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">Very True. Now, if we apply the COSO ERM Framework, Microsoft can better manage these risks.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.6">Right. Starting with Governance and Culture, they need to foster a risk-aware culture and ensure that leadership is committed to addressing these risks.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">Then, under Strategy and Objective-Setting, they should align their risk appetite with their business objectives, especially concerning AI investments and sustainability goals.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.6">For Performance, they need to identify and assess risks, implementing controls to mitigate themâ€”like enhancing cybersecurity measures and ensuring compliance with regulations.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">Exactly. Under Review and Revision, they should continually monitor risks and adjust their strategies accordingly.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.6">And finally, with Information, Communication, and Reporting, they must ensure transparent communication about risks internally and externally.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">Well said, Emma. By applying the COSO ERM Framework, Microsoft can better navigate these evolving risks.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.7">    Absolutely. It's all about being proactive rather than reactive.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.5">Couldn't agree more. Well, that's all the time we have for today. Thanks for tuning into 'Enterprise Risks'.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-Emma2:DragonHDLatestNeural" parameters="temperature=0.7">Thanks everyone! Until next time, stay informed and stay ahead.</voice></speak>
